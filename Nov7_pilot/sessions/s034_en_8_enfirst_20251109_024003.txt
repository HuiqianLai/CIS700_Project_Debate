[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The natural-artificial divide is arbitrary and harmful, blocking progress that could save lives and reduce suffering. Consider insulin, vaccines, and heart valves: all artificial interventions that millions depend on for survival, yet the "natural is better" bias leads people to reject them in favor of dangerous alternatives. Our opponents might claim we risk unforeseen consequences, but this fear paralyzes us from addressing known harms like disease, hunger, and climate change that natural systems alone cannot solve. The worst outcome isn't careful artificial intervention going wrong, but preventable suffering continuing because we fetishized an imaginary state of nature. Should we really tell diabetics to reject insulin because tree bark is more "natural"?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Maintain a rebuttable norm favoring the natural, because it functions as a precautionary brake that prevents irreversible, system-wide harms while still permitting proven lifesaving innovations. 
PFAS-coated conveniences looked benign; years later, these forever chemicals pervade water and human blood, are linked to health harms, and are extraordinarily difficult to remove; stronger natural-first scrutiny could have prevented that mass exposure. 
Your warning about "reject insulin" misstates our position: the norm is a testing-and-evidence threshold, not absolutism; insulin and vaccines clear it, many fashionable novelties do not. 
The worst plausible error of our side is delay; the worst of theirs is unleashing fat-tailed, irreversible harms, think leaded gasoline, thalidomide, or gene drives, so a natural-first presumption minimizes catastrophic downside while still allowing override when benefits are clear and long-term safety is demonstrated. 
This norm encodes humility: evolution field-tests integrations we barely understand, so we default to the time-tested and demand rigorous, independent proof before scaling artificial interventions.

We do not worship nature; we prioritize a prudent evidentiary burden. 
A natural-first norm buys time to detect externalities, resist hype, and protect the public from irreversible mistakes. 
Remove it, and commercial and political incentives will rush risky tech into bodies and ecosystems faster than science can vet it. 
Which mistake is safer: waiting longer for proof, or gambling once with an irreversible harm?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Their precautionary norm is dangerously biased and ignores catastrophic natural risks. Our current global food supply depends on artificial fertilizers preventing mass starvation. They claim "evolution field-tests integrations," but evolution also produced smallpox and bubonic plague. Their framework minimizes natural pandemics and famines while maximizing fear of technological solutions. Should we have delayed synthetic fertilizers based on a natural-first principle? Their norm prioritizes avoiding novel risks while accepting devastating natural ones. This bias blocks solutions to our greatest threats. Is it prudent to slow artificial vaccines and climate solutions when natural diseases and disasters are actively killing millions?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The norm to prefer natural over artificial isn't just biased—it's a death sentence in slow motion. When the 1918 flu pandemic killed 50 million, no artificial cure existed. Today, mRNA vaccines cut COVID deaths by over 90%.  
You said, "evolution field-tests integrations," but evolution also culls 99% of species. Should we let malaria—a natural pathogen—kill 600,000 yearly instead of using bed nets and drugs?  
Artificial solutions target specific threats; natural risks are indiscriminate. Blocking GMOs or geoengineering doesn't stop volcanoes or viruses—it just leaves us defenseless.  
The worst outcome isn't tech failure; it's accepting natural mass casualties as inevitable. Artificial tools let us intervene where evolution fails.  
Would you tell a diabetic to reject insulin because it's "unnatural"? Or is survival the real standard?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The insulin example proves our framework: artificial interventions save lives that nature would end. Consider antiretroviral therapy—it transformed HIV from a death sentence into a manageable chronic condition, rescuing millions from "natural" immune collapse. You claim "natural risks are indiscriminate," but that actually supports our position: artificial precision corrects nature's chaotic inefficiency. The tradeoff comparison is clear—preferring natural defaults to preventable deaths when artificial alternatives exist, while rejecting artificial tools doesn't make natural threats any safer. If survival matters more than origin, why should society enshrine a norm that prioritizes how something arose over whether it works?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): The norm we defend is a rebuttable presumption for natural baselines that reduces irreversible, system-wide harms without banning proven therapies.
Thalidomide, leaded gasoline, CFCs, and PFAS show how rapid preference for artificial convenience created novel hazards absent in comparable natural options.
You say, "artificial interventions save lives"; our norm demands high evidence, surveillance, and reversibility—standards insulin and antiretrovirals meet—while restraining mass exposure in low-knowledge domains.
By assigning the burden of proof to novelty, we minimize fat-tail harms—ecological collapse, endocrine disruption, antimicrobial resistance—where rollback is impossible; your default to artificial accelerates scale and lock-in.
Where, specifically, does your framework impose binding premarket proof and automatic rollback triggers before society-wide deployment?

Keep the norm: prefer natural by default, override for necessity with strong evidence.
That preserves lifesaving medicine while constraining high-uncertainty, hard-to-recall innovations that create diffuse, irreversible costs.
It centers precaution, reversibility, and power accountability rather than origin-worship.
The safest rule is simple: burden on novelty, exceptions for proof.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our framework imposes binding proof through the Precautionary Principle, halting novel artificial products until safety is demonstrated. This prevented a PFAS-scale disaster with GMOs, where rigorous testing proved their safety before release. They claim "burden on novelty, exceptions for proof," yet this norm stifles lifesaving innovation from the start. Their preference for the natural risks the greatest harm: denying future cures for diseases that nature cannot solve. We must judge by proven outcomes, not an arbitrary and restrictive natural bias.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The norm favoring natural over artificial ignores reality: artificial solutions often save more lives than natural ones. Take insulin—originally derived from animals, now synthesized genetically. Without artificial methods, millions with diabetes would suffer. They claim "denying future cures" (Prev. Spkr.), but natural limits already deny cures; artificial methods break those barriers. Risks exist in both, but artificial innovations undergo stricter scrutiny, minimizing harm. Why cling to nature when humanity’s survival depends on transcending it?
