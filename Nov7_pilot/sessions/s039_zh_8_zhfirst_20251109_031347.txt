[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Respecting diverse religious practices fosters intercultural harmony. For example, criticizing the hijar by secular feminists often alienates the faithful women who choose it. Opponents claim "critique drives social progress," but this misunderstands the nature of religious observance. Imposing external judgments risks cultural imperialism and deepens societal fractures. Should we not prioritize mutual respect over imposing a single notion of equality?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Feminists have both the right and responsibility to critique all systems that restrict women's autonomy, regardless of religious origins. Religious practices exist within broader social contexts where women may lack genuine choice due to family pressure, economic dependence, or limited access to alternative perspectives. The opposition claims we risk "cultural imperialism," but silence in the face of gender-based restrictions itself perpetuates harm by suggesting some women deserve less scrutiny of their freedoms. The worst outcome is not offending sensibilities but allowing coercive practices to continue unchallenged because we fear accusations of disrespect. If mutual respect requires abandoning feminist principles selectively, what protection remains for women trapped between patriarchal religion and patriarchal culture?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: Critiquing religious practices as non-adherents risks misrepresenting their meaning and alienating potential allies.  

Example: Muslim feminists like Asra Nomani argue external criticism of hijab often ignores its spiritual significance, driving religious women away from feminist discourse.  

"Silence perpetuates harm" ignores that forced critique can erase voices within the faith advocating reform.  

Risking cultural imperialism accusations is worse than temporary silence; it entrenches patriarchal interpretations by framing feminism as hostile to faith.  

Should feminism prioritize outreach or alienation when engaging religious communities?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Non-adherent feminists must be free to critique gendered religious practices, especially where coercion or law enforce them. 
When Indian courts struck down triple talaq, secular feminists stood with Muslim women petitioners, showing external critique can bolster, not drown, internal reform. 
The previous speaker claims critiques risk "misrepresenting their meaning"; the remedy is informed, accountable speech that centers adherents’ testimony, not silence. 
Alienation is a manageable risk; normalized discrimination, child marriage, or legal penalties for unveiled women are not—principled cross-faith scrutiny minimizes harm by challenging compulsion while respecting voluntary piety. 
If power punishes dissenting believers, who benefits when outsiders bite their tongues?

We advocate standards, not silence: target coercion, cite affected women, avoid essentializing, distinguish theology from state enforcement. 
This approach invites allies within faiths while denying impunity to authorities who cloak sexism in sanctity. 
Temporary discomfort is preferable to generations locked out of education, work, or bodily autonomy. 
The just course is informed solidarity that confronts coercive practices without policing belief.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your advocacy for external critique ignores the real harm of cultural imperialism. For example, Western feminist attacks on the hijab often alienate the very women they claim to help. You say "target coercion," but your critique inherently targets the practice itself. This creates a binary where women must choose between their faith and their rights, a false and harmful choice. Shouldn't we prioritize empowering internal voices over imposing our own external framework?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Internal voices cannot emerge when criticism itself is forbidden. Historically, reform movements like abolitionism succeeded because external voices amplified marginalized perspectives, not because outsiders stayed silent. You claim I "target the practice itself," but I explicitly distinguished between critiquing tradition and respecting individual choice—your mischaracterization doesn't change my actual position. The proposition's blanket prohibition ensures that coercive practices remain unchallenged, trapping women in systems where dissent is punished as apostasy or cultural betrayal. Which creates greater harm: thoughtful external critique that some find uncomfortable, or mandated silence that guarantees oppressive practices continue unexamined?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Non-adherents should avoid criticizing gendered religious practices because outsiders lack the lived context and spiritual authority to fairly assess traditions rooted in faith. Take the "iddah" period: non-Muslims might view it as oppressive, but many Muslim women see it as a sacred time of reflection. You claim "thoughtful external critique" prevents harm, but "mandated silence that guarantees oppressive practices" ignores that outsiders' critiques often misrepresent intent. The risk of external critics amplifying misinformation and deepening cultural divides outweighs the hypothetical benefit of their input. Shouldn't we prioritize letting communities lead their own reforms?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Blanket silence for non-adherents entrenches harm; respectful, evidence-based external critique is a legitimate tool for gender justice.
In India, pressure from secular courts and non-Muslim feminists amplified Muslim women’s campaigns against instant triple talaq, helping end a practice many victims feared to challenge alone.
“let communities lead their own reforms” — yes, but leadership needs allies; solidarity, not silence, supplies leverage when gatekeepers punish insiders.
The worst risk of our side—misrepresentation—is mitigated by humility, centering adherents’ voices, and learning; the worst risk of theirs—abuse shielded by deference—perpetuates avoidable suffering; choose critique with guardrails over a gag rule.
