[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Power transfers in nations with ethnic or religious tensions reduce violence. Indonesia's 1998 shift from Suharto's regime curbed sectarian clashes. "Stability requires continuity" ignores how authoritarian rule fuels resentment. Risks of short-term chaos pale against long-term civil war. Would you risk generations of conflict to avoid temporary disorder?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Opening/Rebuttal/Cross-examination:
In divided, fragile states, preferring turnover from a dominant party makes violence more likely, not less. 
Where dominant-party order collapsed abruptly - Iraq 2003, Libya 2011 - security vacuums, revenge purges, and militia politics produced sectarian cleansing and civil war. 
Your Indonesia example - 'curbed sectarian clashes' - ignores Ambon, Poso, Kalimantan, and East Timor, where the immediate post-1998 transition saw intense communal bloodshed before institutions caught up. 
The worst plausible outcome of an ill-timed transfer is state collapse and mass atrocities; sequenced power-sharing, decentralization, and security guarantees reduce that tail risk more than a leap into alternation. 
Why gamble on a brittle alternation when inclusive, sequenced reform preserves lives and builds trust?

Closing:
Our alternative is not entrenchment; it is negotiated inclusion: enforceable guarantees for minorities, proportional power-sharing, decentralization, and security-sector reform before alternation. 
Kenya 2008 and South Africa's GNU show pacts and sequencing defused ethnic polarization; Cote d'Ivoire 2010-11 shows a disputed transfer can trigger mass killing. 
When stakes are existential, making office loss survivable is safer than forcing rotation on a brittle state. 
Prefer institutions that prevent the worst, not symbolism that risks collapse.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Your examples of collapse occurred after foreign invasion, not democratic transfers of power. Kenya's 2002 peaceful turnover from KANU actually reduced ethnic tensions. You claim "sequencing defused polarization," but power-sharing deals often entrench the very ethnic divisions they claim to solve. The gravest risk is not alternation but the dominant party's systemic corruption and exclusion, which are the true drivers of long-term instability. Why should citizens endure perpetual misrule for a theoretical stability that never arrives? Our model prevents the slow-burn violence of institutionalized discrimination. Forcing a dominant party to face voters is the ultimate accountability mechanism. A system where power can change hands peacefully builds resilient institutions and deters the worst abuses of authority.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Kenya's 2002 transition was followed by the catastrophic 2007 post-election violence that killed over 1,100 people, proving peaceful handover alone guarantees nothing. Your claim that "power-sharing deals entrench ethnic divisions" ignores that premature transfers without institutional safeguards trigger winner-take-all scrambles that militarize ethnic identities far worse. You say dominant parties create "institutionalized discrimination," but forcing sudden alternation replaces predictable grievance channels with existential zero-sum competition where losing power means losing everything. The critical difference is managing violence thresholds: gradual liberalization lets civil society mature and cross-ethnic coalitions form, while imposed transfers in weak states repeatedly produce bloodshed as groups fight desperately to control the state apparatus. If accountability mechanisms work as you claim, why do fragile democracies experience coups at triple the rate of stable hybrid regimes?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Claim: Gradual power transfers with safeguards reduce violence risks compared to entrenched dominance.  
Reason: South Africa’s 1994 transition avoided civil war through negotiated power-sharing, unlike Kenya’s abrupt 2007 clash.  
Address: “forcing sudden alternation replaces predictable grievance channels”—but dominance blocks channels entirely, forcing suppressed tensions to explode later.  
Risks: Gradual reforms let institutions adapt; dominance risks catastrophic backlash. Which scenario risks more lives?  
Question: Would you rather risk controlled reforms or wait for an uncontrolled explosion?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Premature alternation away from a dominant party in divided, fragile states heightens near‑term violence risk; constrained continuity with sequenced reforms better safeguards lives. 
South Africa’s peace rested on negotiated guarantees, security continuity, civil‑service sunset clauses, minority protections, and ANC dominance persisted; it was institutional sequencing, not alternation, that averted war. 
Your claim that "dominance blocks channels entirely" ignores cases like Tanzania, where CCM combined decentralization and intra‑party contestation to defuse ethnic polarization, while Kenya’s 2007 competitive alternation without trusted courts or loser guarantees triggered deadly communal clashes. 
The worst plausible outcome of premature alternation is spiraling tit‑for‑tat massacres; the worst under constrained dominance is slower reform and targeted repression—so sequencing reforms (independent courts, depoliticized security, enforceable loser rights) before real alternation minimizes catastrophic failure. 
Where alternation is attempted before those guarantees, elites mobilize identity fears; when continuity is conditioned, grievances are processed within predictable, lower‑stakes channels. 

Your own exemplar, South Africa, corroborates sequencing under continued dominance rather than turnover. 
Post‑conflict Rwanda and Bosnia show that stability often relies first on strong, constrained incumbency with external oversight, not immediate alternation. 
Our side minimizes the gravest risks by conditioning continuity on verifiable inclusion, devolution, and credible exit guarantees, then phasing competitive turnover. 
Why gamble on Kenya‑style bloodletting when South Africa‑style sequencing reduces the tail risk?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our model prioritizes preventing catastrophic ethnic violence over all else. The opposition’s “constrained continuity” often entrenches permanent dominance, as seen in Rwanda where power never genuinely alternates. They cite "sequenced reforms before alternation," but this indefinitely postpones political equality. Their model risks frozen authoritarianism, while ours, by insisting on turnover, prevents the permanent exclusion that fuels far greater long-term conflict. A system that never changes hands is not a democracy, but a powder keg.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Our framework prevents the very catastrophic violence the proposition fears by prioritizing stability over ideological purity. History shows that premature power transfers in ethnically divided societies—Iraq post-2003, Kenya 2007—trigger the bloodshed they claim to prevent, while gradual institution-building in Botswana and pre-1994 Mauritius created durable multiethnic governance. They claim our model creates a "powder keg," but their forced alternation is the spark that ignites it, replacing theoretical permanent exclusion with immediate, actual violence. The worst plausible outcome is not delayed democracy but ethnic cleansing during chaotic transitions—our constrained continuity trades slower political change for saved lives, the only moral calculation in fragile states.
