[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The citizen welfare standard better protects democratic values and prevents corporate domination of society. The consumer welfare standard narrowly focuses on prices and output, ignoring how monopolies accumulate political power, suppress wages, and exploit workers who are also consumers. Critics claim broader standards create uncertainty, but the consumer welfare approach has failed to stop tech giants from crushing competitors and manipulating public discourse. When we optimize only for cheap goods, we risk sacrificing labor rights, privacy, small business opportunity, and the economic dispersal necessary for healthy democracy. Should we really accept monopolistic control over our digital infrastructure and political conversation just because products remain nominally affordable?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): The consumer welfare standard should remain the backbone of antitrust because it is predictable, administrable, and pro-innovation. It channels courts toward measurable effects—price, output, quality, and innovation—illustrated by United States v. Microsoft, which curbed exclusionary tying while preserving a competitive browser and app ecosystem. You claim it "narrowly focuses on prices and output"; in reality consumer welfare already encompasses nonprice harms like degraded privacy, reduced choice, and slowed innovation, and agencies routinely argue these theories under existing doctrine. A vague "citizen welfare" test invites political horse-trading—folding labor, speech, and environmental aims into antitrust—producing unpredictable enforcement, litigation chill for entrants, and a tool that future governments could weaponize against disfavored industries. Keep antitrust about competition and address worker rights, privacy, and speech with targeted labor, data, and media laws that set clear, democratically debated rules.

Even if consumer welfare sometimes under-deters, the backstop is sectoral regulation and conduct remedies, not turning antitrust into a catch‑all constitution. The worst plausible error under citizen welfare is politicized market design that scares off investment and entrenches incumbents via bespoke, lobbyist-crafted exemptions. Under consumer welfare, errors are more legible, reviewable, and correctable, preserving dynamic rivalry and predictable incentives for challengers. Don’t politicize antitrust; fix noncompetition harms with targeted laws and keep competition law anchored to measurable consumer harm.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The citizen standard better governs modern digital markets where consumer prices are zero. It directly addresses harms like data exploitation that the consumer standard ignores. You claim agencies "routinely argue these theories," yet courts consistently dismiss privacy cases for lacking price effects. The worst outcome under consumer welfare is entrenched monopolies eroding democracy, which targeted laws cannot fix. Shouldn't antitrust evolve to confront the actual threats of market power today?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The consumer welfare standard remains the most effective framework for balancing innovation and fairness. Zero-price markets don’t negate harm—the FTC’s 2019 Facebook case explicitly cited data exploitation as a consumer injury, proving agencies can adapt. You say courts dismiss privacy cases for "lacking price effects," but dismissing price ignores how data fuels targeted ads, harming consumers through manipulation, not just pricing. Shifting to citizen welfare risks overregulating beneficial innovation, like free services, while monopolies persist under any standard if enforcement fails. Should we abandon a proven system for a vague alternative that risks stifling progress?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The consumer welfare standard's adaptability is precisely why we need citizen welfare—it constantly requires case-by-case workarounds for harms it wasn't designed to address. Your Facebook example proves my point: the FTC had to creatively reinterpret consumer harm because the standard fundamentally prioritizes pricing efficiency over data rights, making every privacy case an uphill battle. You ask if we should "abandon a proven system," but proven for whom—consumers enjoyed lower search costs while Google manipulated ad auctions and suppressed rival technologies for over a decade before enforcement. The citizen welfare standard minimizes the worst outcome by preventing democratic harms like disinformation amplification and labor exploitation before they metastasize, rather than waiting years for agencies to retrofit consumer protection tools. If the current standard works so well, why do tech monopolies now control our information ecosystems, elections, and public discourse with minimal accountability?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Consumer welfare already encompasses non-price harms like privacy, quality, and innovation without politicizing antitrust.
The Microsoft case curbed exclusionary conduct threatening innovation despite zero prices, preserving browser competition and platform openness.
You say it "constantly requires case-by-case workarounds"; that disciplined, precedential adjudication beats an amorphous citizen-welfare mandate lacking administrable limits.
The Google search monopolization ruling confirms consumer welfare addresses exclusionary defaults harming quality and innovation, even at zero price.
By contrast, citizen-welfare invites actions on speech, labor, or "disinformation" theories without tests, chilling entry and favoring incumbents who game politics.

Keep consumer welfare but strengthen it: clearer merger presumptions for nascent rivals, recognition of privacy as quality, and injunctions against exclusionary defaults.
That delivers faster, predictable enforcement without converting antitrust into a roving public-policy tool.
Citizen welfare’s vagueness empowers political cycles to pick winners and police speech—the more dangerous tail risk.
Why trade the rule-of-law gains of consumer welfare for a standard that lets enforcers decide our politics?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponents champion a system that has demonstrably failed to address today's monopolistic threats. The consumer welfare standard is inherently myopic, ignoring how corporate consolidation erodes democratic discourse and worker power. They claim it addresses "non-price harms," yet this requires constant, inefficient workarounds for problems it was never designed to solve. A citizen standard directly tackles the systemic risks of concentrated private control over public life, preventing the far greater danger of a corporatized democracy. We must choose an antitrust law that protects our society, not just our pocketbooks.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The citizen welfare standard risks overregulation that stifles innovation and economic growth. The consumer welfare standard has driven decades of technological progress and affordable goods, evidenced by smartphones and streaming services. You claim it "ignores how corporate consolidation erodes democratic discourse," but antitrust laws under this standard have broken up monopolies like AT&T, directly preserving competition. Shifting to a citizen standard risks vague, politically driven enforcement, where regulators could target successful firms without clear harm to consumers. Isn’t preserving economic freedom and innovation a better safeguard against corporatized democracy than vague, expansive powers?
