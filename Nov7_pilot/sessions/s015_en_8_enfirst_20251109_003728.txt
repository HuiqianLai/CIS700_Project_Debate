[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): A team's success depends on unity and discipline above any single talent. A player whose presence creates division or distraction fundamentally weakens the squad's collective resolve. You might argue "their skill is irreplaceable," but no individual is bigger than the team. The risk of internal conflict causing a catastrophic team failure far outweighs the benefit of their inclusion. Should we gamble the entire tournament on one disruptive individual?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): We should include the player and manage any issues, because performance upside outweighs manageable risks.
Italy kept the often-criticized Mario Balotelli at Euro 2012; his brace versus Germany put them in the final—proof that a volatile talent can be decisive when it matters.
You say "no individual is bigger than the team"; inclusion doesn’t elevate them above the team—it channels their value within rules, leadership groups, and conditional selection.
Excluding him guarantees a permanent drop in quality and predictability in attack; including him with clear codes, senior-player buffers, and the power to bench or send home mid-tournament contains the downside.
Isn’t the real gamble voluntarily benching your match-winner before a ball is kicked?

Tournament football is decided by moments; elite moment-makers are scarce.
Management tools—contractual clauses, fines, rotations, psychologist support—convert personality risk into controlled variables.
The worst plausible outcome of inclusion is contained; the worst outcome of exclusion is irreversible loss of winning moments.
Choose managed risk over guaranteed weakness.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Excluding the player minimizes team risk, even if it means sacrificing potential upside. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s 2018 World Cup exclusion by Sweden shows how removing a volatile star preserved team cohesion; they reached the quarterfinals without his drama. You say “managed risk” converts personality issues into controlled variables—but tournaments aren’t labs. One off-field incident can unravel morale mid-competition. Exclusion trades uncertain “moments” for guaranteed unity; inclusion risks chaos. Would you bet a tournament on one player’s self-control?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The Ibrahimovic example actually proves our case, not theirs. Sweden's quarterfinal run came against weaker opponents; they lost immediately when facing a quality side in England, exposing the talent gap exclusion creates. They claim "one off-field incident can unravel morale mid-competition," but professional teams handle discipline issues during tournaments routinely without imploding. Trading elite ability for "guaranteed unity" means guaranteed mediocrity when facing superior opponents who kept their best players. The worst plausible outcome isn't a manageable behavioral issue; it's losing winnable matches because you voluntarily weakened your squad. Why deliberately enter a World Cup less equipped to win than your rivals?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your argument that "professional teams handle discipline issues routinely" ignores tournament reality. The French team's 2010 mutiny proves a single disruptive player can destroy an entire campaign. You claim we voluntarily weaken the squad, but we are strengthening it by prioritizing reliable cohesion over volatile talent. The worst outcome is not losing a match; it is losing the entire team's focus and unity. Why risk a catastrophic team fracture for one player's unreliable brilliance?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Excluding him is a blunt instrument that heightens competitive risk without guaranteeing harmony. 
Brazil 1994 re-integrated a temperamental Romário under clear rules and leadership oversight; he delivered the goals that won them the World Cup. 
Your claim that "a single disruptive player can destroy" misreads 2010 France; it was a systemic leadership failure—Domenech, federation chaos, and multiple actors—Anelka was removed early, yet mismanagement, not one talent’s presence, imploded the campaign. 
Risk calculus: conditional selection with a zero-tolerance code, leadership group enforcement, and staged sanctions preserves upside while containing behavior; blanket exclusion sacrifices irreplaceable match-winning value and overestimates cohesion gained by removing one individual. 
If he accepts strict conditions and monitored conduct, what concrete risk remains that cannot be mitigated?

Cohesion is built by standards and leadership, not by abandoning elite talent. 
The worst plausible outcome we minimize is meltdown: clear protocols and swift sanctions deter it while retaining firepower. 
Your approach’s worst plausible outcome is a neutered attack that dies in knockout moments. 
Selective, enforceable inclusion protects unity and wins matches—exclusion protects optics and risks defeat.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Excluding the player is the only way to guarantee team harmony and prevent catastrophic collapse.  
In 2014, Luis Suárez’s bite led to his expulsion, but Uruguay’s squad rallied without him—proving discipline outweighs individual brilliance.  
“Cohesion is built by standards, not abandoning talent” ignores that standards fail when one player repeatedly violates them.  
The risk of a meltdown from a disruptive star outweighs the marginal gain of their skill; structured exclusion ensures no single actor can derail the team.  
Can we afford to bet a tournament on one player’s unpredictability when the cost of failure is elimination?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Exclusion guarantees predictable mediocrity, while inclusion offers the chance to win the tournament outright. The proposition's Suárez example actually proves our case—Uruguay advanced further WITH him in 2010 (fourth place) than in tournaments where he was absent or excluded, demonstrating that elite talent elevates performance despite occasional discipline issues. Their claim that "standards fail when one player repeatedly violates them" assumes management has exhausted all options, yet we've shown targeted interventions, behavioral contracts, and veteran mentorship successfully reformed disruptive stars without exclusion. The worst plausible outcome isn't a volatile player causing problems—it's losing winnable matches because you voluntarily weakened your squad, then watching that excluded player dominate for another team four years later.
