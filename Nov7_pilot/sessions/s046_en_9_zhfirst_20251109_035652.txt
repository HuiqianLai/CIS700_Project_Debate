[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Education systems should strategically inflate children's academic self-perception because early confidence is the foundation for lifelong learning and achievement. When children believe they can succeed, they develop resilience and willingness to tackle challenging material rather than avoiding difficult subjects out of fear. Critics worry this creates fragile students unprepared for real-world feedback, but research shows children who receive encouragement early actually handle setbacks better because they view failure as temporary rather than confirming inherent inadequacy. The alternative—brutal honesty with young learners—risks creating permanent disengagement where students conclude they simply "aren't smart" and stop trying altogether. Should we really tell eight-year-olds they're failures when we could instead build the confidence that makes future growth possible?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Education should calibrate, not inflate, self-perception: honest, kind, specific feedback builds durable motivation and real competence.
When schools avoid failure and shower praise, students miscalibrate; they coast until external assessments or real tasks expose gaps, and many disengage after that shock.
You say "early confidence is the foundation"; yet research on inflated praise shows it reduces challenge-seeking in vulnerable learners, while growth-mindset gains come from accurate, process-focused feedback—not unearned accolades.
If we’re too candid, students may feel bruised; we mitigate harms with low-stakes practice, redo policies, and process praise.
If your approach fails, children meet high-stakes reality unprepared, their trust collapses, and equity gaps widen.

Confidence should be earned through progress on clear standards, not inflated by policy.
Calibrated, truthful feedback plus scaffolded retries fosters resilience without deception.
Over-inflation creates brittle learners, erodes trust, and entrenches low expectations.
If feedback can’t be trusted, what anchors a child’s learning?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our approach builds the resilience to handle future challenges. Consider that early academic identity often dictates lifelong engagement. You claim "accurate feedback builds durable motivation," yet constant calibration ignores developmental needs. A child protected from failure is not brittle but brave enough to try. We must choose between early discouragement and nurtured potential. Is a student's initial confidence not the most vital learning tool?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Over-inflating academic self-perception harms long-term growth. Students given inflated praise often struggle when real-world feedback arrives. You claim "protected from failure is not brittle but brave"—yet avoiding failure denies practice in resilience. Risking false confidence now leads to greater collapse later when challenges are unavoidable. Would you rather children learn to adapt or crumble when reality contradicts their self-view?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): False confidence is not the risk—crushing self-doubt is. Research consistently shows that children who experience chronic academic failure develop learned helplessness, abandoning effort entirely rather than building resilience through repeated discouragement.

You claim students need to "practice resilience" through failure, but eight-year-olds don't analyze setbacks rationally—they internalize them as identity. A child told repeatedly they're failing math doesn't develop grit; they develop math anxiety and avoidance behaviors that persist into adulthood.

Your "reality contradicts their self-view" framework ignores that supportive environments prepare students emotionally to handle future challenges. Confident learners seek harder problems; defeated ones quit before trying, making the brittleness you fear a self-fulfilling prophecy created by harsh early feedback.

The worst outcome isn't a teenager discovering college is harder than expected—it's a ten-year-old deciding they're stupid and checking out of learning permanently. We can teach critical thinking and persistence without destroying the foundational belief that effort matters.

When does your "real-world feedback" actually help a struggling child learn, versus simply confirming they should stop trying?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Over-inflating feedback harms struggling children by obscuring what to improve and eroding trust. 
A child praised 'Amazing essay!' despite misspellings repeats errors; feedback 'Great ideas—fix these five words' builds skill and persistence. 
You say "eight-year-olds don't analyze setbacks rationally"; exactly—so sugarcoating confuses signals, while kind, accurate steps prevent identity collapse. 
Harsh labels can breed helplessness, but inflated grades delay correction until failures are public and consequential; calibrated, task-level feedback plus re-dos minimizes both. 
If weak work still earns praise, what triggers timely intervention before misconceptions calcify?

Children need hope, but they also need accurate information to improve. 
Our alternative pairs warm tone, process praise, and clear next steps with chances to revise, not labels. 
This protects self-worth while preventing the brittle overconfidence that explodes at transition points. 
The safest system is honest and supportive, not inflated.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponents claim "inflated grades delay correction," but this misses the core purpose. An over-inflated foundation of self-belief is the necessary fuel for the long, difficult journey of learning. Their model of constant, calibrated correction risks teaching children to fear failure above all else. We choose the risk of initial overconfidence over the guaranteed outcome of early disengagement, because a child who believes they are brilliant will strive to become so long after a "corrected" child has given up.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Over-inflating self-perception doesn't fuel learning—it creates fragility. Students who never face failure lack resilience; when reality hits, their confidence crumbles. You say "a child who believes they are brilliant will strive"—but what if they're not? False beliefs lead to disillusionment, not perseverance. The risk of early disengagement is real, but so is the lifelong harm of unearned confidence. Would you rather a child learn to grow from failure or collapse when reality contradicts their illusions?
