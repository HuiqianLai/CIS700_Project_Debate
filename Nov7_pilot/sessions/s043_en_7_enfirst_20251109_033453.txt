[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Societal factors are the primary drivers of mental health crises. Consider how economic recessions universally increase rates of depression and anxiety. You might argue "individual therapy is sufficient," but this ignores the root cause. Focusing on individuals risks systemic neglect, while our approach prevents widespread suffering by targeting preventable, population-level stressors. Shouldn't our priority be to stop the factory causing the harm, rather than just treating the injuries?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Individual factors are irreplaceable in addressing mental health. A person's trauma history or coping mechanisms can't be reduced to societal averages. "Focusing on individuals risks systemic neglect" ignores that systemic fixes fail without individual resilience. Prioritizing societal factors risks neglecting those whose suffering stems from personal history, worsening outcomes. Can we afford to leave vulnerable individuals without tailored care?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our motion prioritizes societal factors, not abandons individual care entirely, making opposition's framing a false dichotomy. When we address poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to services, we create conditions where individual interventions can actually succeed. The claim that "systemic fixes fail without individual resilience" ignores that resilience itself requires foundational security like housing, income stability, and community support that only systemic change provides. Opposition's approach leaves millions trapped in conditions that guarantee mental health crises regardless of personal therapy, while our framework prevents harm before individualized treatment becomes necessary. Should we spend resources treating endless individuals one by one while ignoring the societal wellspring poisoning their mental health?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Preferring societal over individual factors delays help and misallocates resources. 
In acute suicide risk or first-episode psychosis, safety planning, crisis response, medication, and family support prevent harm within days; policy reforms cannot. 
You say "not abandons individual care entirely"; preference still skews budgets, training, and metrics, inflating waitlists and emergency holds. 
The trade-off is timing: overweight society and accept years of under-treatment; overweight individuals and leave upstream stressors partly unsolved. 
We minimize the worst outcomes by guaranteeing rapid, person-centered care now while funding targeted, measurable social supports that demonstrably aid recovery. 

Systems change matters, but preference without guardrails starves the clinic floor. 
Make social policy compete on evidence and timelines, not ideology. 
Put immediate access, continuity, and personalization at the front of the queue. 
When a teenager arrives tonight in psychotic crisis, which focus saves them by morning?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your argument dangerously misdiagnoses the problem by prioritizing crisis management over prevention. Societal focus prevents crises by tackling the poverty and trauma that fuel psychosis and suicide in the first place. You claim "preference skews budgets," but individual-centric models have already created the overwhelmed clinics you describe. The worst outcome is a perpetual crisis factory, which we minimize by stopping problems at their source. Why build more emergency rooms when we can prevent people from needing them at all?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Individual-centric models don't ignore prevention; they integrate it through personalized early interventions. A patient with a family history of depression may need tailored therapy to prevent escalation, which societal factors alone can't provide.  
"Why build more emergency rooms when we can prevent people from needing them at all?" But societal fixes take decades; individual care addresses crises now.  
Overwhelmed clinics stem from systemic neglect, not individual focus—but abandoning personalized care risks leaving vulnerable people untreated.  
The worst outcome is ignoring those whose mental health crises aren't tied to obvious socioeconomic factors. Individual models catch these cases before they escalate.  
Can we afford to wait for societal change when lives depend on immediate, personalized support?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): We focus on societal factors not to abandon individual care, but to prevent the overwhelming majority of mental health crises from occurring in the first place. While opponents ask if we can afford to wait for societal change, the reality is that individualized models have dominated for decades yet mental health crises continue escalating because they treat symptoms without addressing root causes. The claim that "societal fixes take decades" ignores that maintaining poverty, inequality, and workplace exploitation also perpetuates suffering for decades while only helping those privileged enough to access personalized care. The worst outcome isn't failing to catch isolated cases—it's condemning millions to preventable mental illness because we invested in ambulances at the bottom of the cliff rather than building the fence at the top.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): We should not prefer societal factors over individual ones when addressing mental health.
When opioid overdoses surged, medication-assisted treatment and naloxone saved lives immediately; wage laws or housing reforms, however valuable, could not avert tonight’s deaths.
You say "individualized models have dominated for decades"; crises also rose alongside social media, the pandemic, and economic shocks, while access to evidence-based care remained scarce—blaming the model confuses correlation with causation.
A preference shapes budgets; prioritizing societal fixes risks political gridlock and service cuts, producing preventable suicides and psychosis relapses; our approach funds crisis lines, therapy, and medications now while supporting targeted upstream policies with near-term impact, minimizing deaths during any transition.
In emergencies we build the fence and keep ambulances running, because people are falling today.

This debate isn’t prevention versus treatment; it’s whether we sideline individualized care by preferring societal explanations.
Focusing primarily on structure overfits a complex, heterogeneous condition and misallocates scarce time for those already decompensating.
We embrace pragmatic upstream fixes—safe housing pilots, anti-bullying programs, fair scheduling—while guaranteeing rapid, person-centered care that measurably reduces suffering now.
Choose balance that averts deaths today and builds resilience tomorrow—do not prefer one lens at the cost of lives.
