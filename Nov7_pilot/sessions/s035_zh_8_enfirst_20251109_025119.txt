[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): 我方主张在西非广泛推广Sankofa哲学，以“回首取经”推动可持续现代化。
最有力的证据是尼日尔与布基纳法索复兴传统农法（如农民管理的自然再生、扎伊坑），在气候压力下恢复土壤与生计。
对于“会拖累现代化”的担忧，Sankofa强调从有效传统中取其精华，与科学验证并行，而非复古倒车。
风险在于浪漫化落后做法；但更大的风险是忽视在地知识导致政策水土不服，Sankofa通过社区参与、伦理筛选与试点评估，将最坏后果最小化。
忽视祖辈已验证的解法，难道不是更昂贵的冒险？

推广Sankofa不是守旧，而是以过去照亮未来。
它把教育、治理与发展项目锚定在当地语境与成功经验。
配套科学评估与人权底线，可避免糟粕复燃、提升政策韧性。
让西非以自己的脚本创新前行，这就是最稳的现代化。
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Sankofa philosophy risks stalling West Africa's urgent modernization by prioritizing selective tradition over scalable solutions. Ghana's failed attempt to revive indigo dyeing using ancestral methods collapsed due to chemical alternatives being cheaper and faster. "配套科学评估与人权底线" cannot guarantee efficiency when traditional methods lack mass-production capacity. Prioritizing past practices diverts resources from renewable energy grids and digital infrastructure needed for climate resilience. Should we risk development deadlocks for nostalgic experiments?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Your "development deadlocks" argument ignores Sankofa's practical synergy with modernity. Consider Burkina Faso's Gando Primary School, where architect Diébédo Francis Kéré fused traditional clay construction with modern engineering, creating a sustainable, low-cost, and climatically resilient structure acclaimed worldwide. You claim "traditional methods lack mass-production capacity." This misses Sankofa's core principle: it is not a wholesale return but a selective integration. Prioritizing indigenous knowledge in architecture and agriculture builds climate-resilient communities from the ground up, avoiding the worst outcomes of dependency on expensive, imported foreign systems. Why must development mean erasing our own proven, adaptive ingenuity?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The Gando School example actually proves our point about Sankofa's limited scalability. One acclaimed architect completing one rural school over years demonstrates a boutique success, not a replicable model for West Africa's 400 million people facing urgent development needs. Your phrase "selective integration" reveals the fatal flaw: who decides which traditions to keep, and doesn't this picking-and-choosing contradict Sankofa's premise of comprehensively valuing ancestral wisdom? The real tradeoff is clear: while we experiment with clay construction techniques, our competitors deploy standardized, proven infrastructure at scale, widening the development gap that condemns millions to preventable poverty. Can selective nostalgia truly compete against nations implementing systematic, evidence-based development strategies?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Sankofa is a scalable, evidence-led lens for critical retrieval, not nostalgia.
In Niger, Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration revived traditional tree stewardship to restore farms at scale, boosting yields and resilience.
“limited scalability” is disproved by Ghana’s CHPS and the Sahel’s Nubian Vault program, which institutionalize community-rooted design while meeting modern standards.
Standardized imports risk stranded assets, poor maintenance, and backlash; Sankofa’s participatory selection, local supply chains, and engineering verification minimize worst-case failure without slowing delivery.
If “evidence-based” is your benchmark, will you reject FMNR, CHPS, and Nubian Vault because their strength came from tradition?

Promoting Sankofa means systematizing what works from the past through community choice and testing.
From Yacouba Sawadogo’s revived zaï pits to Tostan’s community-led reforms, West Africa has already scaled tradition-informed solutions that stick.
The real risk is brittle, imported uniformity that fails silently after ribbon-cutting; Sankofa hedges with ownership and maintainability.
Choose Sankofa: scale with roots, not short-lived speed.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Sankofa’s reliance on traditional practices risks overlooking proven modern solutions with clearer efficacy. The Nubian Vault program’s success hinges on adapting ancient techniques to current needs, not purely reviving them. You claim Sankofa “hedges with ownership and maintainability”—but what if communities reject outdated methods that no longer suit their realities? Prioritizing tradition risks stagnation when dynamic challenges demand innovation. Why gamble on untested revivals when scalable, evidence-backed alternatives exist?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position champions Sankofa as a dynamic process of informed adaptation. The Nubian Vault exemplifies this, achieving success precisely by integrating ancestral wisdom with modern needs, not by discarding tradition. You claim this "risks stagnation" from "outdated methods." This misrepresents Sankofa as a rigid revival, ignoring its core principle of selective reclamation. Our approach minimizes the worst outcome of cultural disintegration and dependency, ensuring solutions are owned and sustained by the communities themselves. Ultimately, Sankofa offers the most resilient path forward by building a future that is both progressive and culturally grounded.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Our opposition stands firm: widespread Sankofa promotion risks diverting West Africa from evidence-based development strategies that address urgent contemporary challenges. While our opponents celebrate "selective reclamation," they never explain who decides which traditions merit revival or how communities avoid romanticizing practices that failed historically amid different but equally harsh conditions. Their Nubian Vault example actually proves our point—success came from architectural innovation and NGO resources, not philosophical frameworks that every community must now adopt region-wide. The worst outcome isn't cultural evolution but opportunity cost: resources spent institutionalizing backward-looking philosophy could fund schools, healthcare, and infrastructure that demonstrably reduce poverty today. West Africa deserves forward-focused policies, not continental experiments in nostalgia.
