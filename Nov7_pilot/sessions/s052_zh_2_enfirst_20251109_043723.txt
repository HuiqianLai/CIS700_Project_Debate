[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): American involvement in Panama provided critical stability and economic development. The Panama Canal expansion, supported by the US, boosted global trade and created thousands of local jobs. Some claim it was "purely for US interests," but this ignores Panama's sovereign control and revenue from the canal. While national pride is vital, the risk of economic isolation was far greater without a strong partner. Panama's prosperity today is a direct result of that strategic cooperation.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): American intervention in Panama did not benefit the nation but entrenched its dependency. The 1989 US invasion, justified as protecting the canal, left hundreds dead and demolished entire neighborhoods. "Panama's sovereign control and revenue from the canal" ignores decades of US-imposed treaties that prioritized American interests over local autonomy. Economic gains came at the cost of political subjugation, with the US dictating canal terms until 1999. Would Panama trade short-term jobs for long-term sovereignty and self-determination?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): American intervention ultimately enabled Panama’s sovereign control, democratic restoration, and long-term prosperity.
The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties guaranteed full transfer in 1999, after which the Panamanian-run canal expanded in 2016 and became a national revenue engine.
You claim "dictating canal terms until 1999"; that timeline secured a peaceful, internationally recognized handover that built capacity and kept profits at home.
The 1989 invasion caused grievous loss, yet it ended Noriega’s annulled election, dismantled his repressive apparatus, and enabled the stable transition mandated by treaty.
Compared to indefinite dictatorship plus sanctions, which path leaves Panama more sovereign and prosperous?

Post-handover, canal revenues fund Panamanian priorities, from logistics hubs to social programs.
Dollarization and canal stability anchored investment and a diversified services economy.
The unavoidable tradeoff was short-term violence versus long-term institutional sovereignty; Panama today governs the asset once controlled by foreign troops.
That enduring sovereignty and prosperity are the clearest benefits of intervention.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The previous speaker conflates outcomes with justification, ignoring that intervention itself created the crises it supposedly resolved. The 1989 invasion killed over 3,000 Panamanians according to independent estimates, destroyed entire neighborhoods like El Chorrillo, and violated international law to remove a dictator the U.S. previously armed and funded. You claim intervention "ended Noriega's annulled election," but Washington supported Noriega throughout the 1980s despite knowing about drug trafficking and repression, only turning against him when he ceased serving American interests. The real tradeoff is not dictatorship versus sovereignty, but recognizing that American intervention consistently prioritized U.S. strategic control over genuine Panamanian self-determination, leaving a legacy of dependency masked as partnership. Why should Panama thank the arsonist for eventually leaving the fire station?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): The intervention ultimately secured Panama's democratic future. Operation Just Cause removed a narco-dictator who had nullified a democratic election. You claim the U.S. "created the crises it resolved." That ignores Noriega's own brutal agency and the will of the Panamanian people. The alternative was enduring a criminal regime, a far greater threat to sovereignty. Does Panama not deserve credit for its successful democracy post-intervention?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): The U.S. intervention did not secure democracy but entrenched instability. Noriega’s rise was enabled by U.S. training and earlier support, proving their role in creating the crisis. "The alternative was enduring a criminal regime" ignores that U.S. policies fueled Noriega’s power through arms and immunity. Post-intervention, Panama faced years of U.S.-imposed neoliberal policies and military presence, undermining sovereignty. If democracy was the goal, why did the U.S. prioritize canal control over Panamanian self-determination?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): U.S. intervention ultimately benefited Panama by restoring elected civilian rule and dismantling a predatory military.
Operation Just Cause removed Noriega, seated the internationally certified 1989 winner Guillermo Endara, and dissolved the Panama Defense Forces, paving the way for Panama’s lasting demilitarization.
You say "U.S. policies fueled Noriega’s power"; responsibility for past errors does not negate the net gains from ending his annulled-election, narco-repressive regime and reopening space for free media, parties, and civil society.
And rather than prioritizing canal control over Panamanian self-determination, the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties were honored on schedule in 1999; a democratic Panama assumed full canal authority and later led its expansion.
The trade-off was real—civilian harm and economic shock—but the worst plausible alternative was an entrenched narco-dictatorship nullifying elections; by restoring constitutional governance and ending the army, intervention reduced future coups’ risk and enabled accountable management of canal revenues.

Across three decades since 1989, Panama has held competitive elections, abolished its standing army, and managed its canal autonomously—outcomes impossible under Noriega.
Past U.S. complicity deserves scrutiny, yet remedying harm by restoring democracy and sovereignty still improved Panamanians’ prospects.
Our side accepts costs but averts the worst-case: perpetual militarized kleptocracy with no lawful transfer of power.
Panama today governs its canal and its politics; that durable sovereignty is the intervention’s enduring benefit.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The proposition asks whether Panama benefited, yet hundreds of civilian deaths and a sovereignty violation cannot be justified by outcomes Washington could have achieved through lawful means. The speaker claims intervention "restored constitutional governance," but international law prohibits regime change by force; supporting Panama's own civil society and regional diplomatic pressure would have toppled Noriega without invasion. Economic sanctions, OAS mediation, and internal resistance were already weakening the dictatorship when U.S. tanks rolled in, preempting a homegrown transition and teaching Panama that foreign military power trumps self-determination. Yes, democracy endures today, but crediting the invader ignores Panamanians who rebuilt their institutions despite, not because of, Operation Just Cause's trauma and the precedent that might makes right.
