[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): We prefer a change of power from dominant parties in divided developing states because alternation dilutes ethnic capture and makes inclusion a winning strategy.
In Ghana and Senegal, peaceful alternations ended one-party dominance, curbed patronage monopolies, and strengthened courts and electoral commissions, reducing the salience of ethnic blocs without inventing new grievances.
The opposition says, "stability requires continuity"; yet continuity under dominant parties often hardens zero-sum ethnic patronage, turning routine contests into existential battles once succession disputes arise.
Transitions can spark short-term tension, but enforcing term limits, independent security oversight, and credible election management gives losers a path back, lowering rebellion incentives and averting the worst outcome—entrenched exclusion that metastasizes into civil conflict.
Continuity feels calm until it explodes; planned alternation manages risk.

Where dominance fuses state and faction, losers see no future, fueling radicalization; alternation reopens democratic routes for minorities.
Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria’s 2015 turnover show that precedent-setting defeats temper zero-sum politics and professionalize institutions.
Our model accepts managed short-term turbulence to avert long-term capture, pairing alternation with independent commissions, power-sharing rules, and security-sector neutrality.
The surest way to prevent identity-fueled breakdown is to normalize losing power.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Dominant parties in divided developing states often provide the only viable bulwark against ethnic fragmentation, and forced alternation risks destabilizing fragile institutions. Malaysia’s UMNO, despite controversies, maintained multi-ethnic coalitions for decades; abrupt power shifts in 2018 nearly collapsed race-based economic pacts. You claim "alternation reopens democratic routes for minorities," but sudden turnover can empower extremists when mainstream parties lose credibility. The tradeoff between short-term turbulence and long-term capture favors continuity: entrenched parties, however flawed, often prevent identity-fueled breakdowns better than untested alternations. Can fragile states afford to gamble on opposition parties that lack proven institutional safeguards?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition champions dominant parties as stability guarantors. Consider Kenya, where power alternation in 2002 and 2013 diffused ethnic tensions by integrating opposition groups into governance. You claim they "prevent identity-fueled breakdowns," yet these parties often institutionalize discrimination, creating the very tensions they claim to manage. The risk of continued exclusion and violence under an entrenched party far outweighs transitional instability. Should citizens permanently sacrifice political dignity for a stability that perpetuates their marginalization?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Kenya's example actually proves our case: successful transitions occurred only after decades of institutional development under KANU's dominant party rule that built state capacity and integrated various ethnic groups into bureaucratic structures. The proposition claims dominant parties "institutionalize discrimination," but Kenya's peaceful 2002 transition happened precisely because the dominant party had already established power-sharing mechanisms and patronage networks that new leaders could inherit rather than build from scratch. Rushed power changes without these foundations typically trigger violence, as seen in Ethiopia where the 2018 transition from TPLF dominance unleashed the devastating Tigray War that killed hundreds of thousands. We minimize catastrophic civil war by allowing institutional maturation before transition, while the proposition gambles entire populations on the hope that marginalized groups will suddenly cooperate once empowered. Why should we risk genocidal conflict for theoretical dignity when gradual reform under stable institutions offers both safety and progressive inclusion?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Dominant parties in divided states harden zero-sum ethnic patronage; credible alternation reduces violence by creating incentives to court multiple groups and respect losers.
Ghana’s 2000 and 2008 turnovers normalized concession and alternation, cooling Ashanti–Ewe tensions; Senegal’s 2000 transition from the Socialist Party proceeded peacefully and broadened inclusion.
You say "Kenya's example proves our case"; yet KANU’s dominance enabled the 1992–97 ethnic clashes and land expulsions, and the 2002 alternation succeeded because opposition unity finally outcompeted that patronage machine—not because one-party rule had benevolently prepared democracy.
Our worst-case is state-organized atrocity under unchecked dominance (Rwanda 1994, Sudan’s Darfur); theirs is transitional unrest; Ethiopia shows delay magnifies reckoning costs, while our model mandates pre-transition pacts, independent electoral bodies, and security-sector guarantees to spread vetoes and cap escalation.
Why bet safety on the architects of abuse instead of institutionalized alternation that makes ethnic weaponization electorally irrational?

Change from dominant parties is not a gamble; it is risk management through plural incentives.
Where alternation took hold—Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria 2015—violence decreased and concessions became routine.
Where dominance persisted—Rwanda pre‑1994, Sudan under NCP—state violence scaled catastrophically.
Prefer transitions with safeguards because they minimize worst-case harms while unlocking inclusive governance.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Claim: Alternation risks trigger violence when institutions are weak, as seen in Kenya’s 2007 post-election crisis.  

Strongest reason: Kenya’s 2007–08 clashes killed 1,300 after opposition won, proving alternation without institutional safeguards escalates ethnic violence.  

You say “alternation reduces violence by creating incentives to court multiple groups”—yet Kenya’s 2007 chaos showed losing elites weaponize ethnicity when checks fail.  

Risk tradeoff: Your “safeguards” like electoral bodies failed in Kenya; dominant parties, when reforming, can build gradual trust—Uganda’s 1986–2021 NRM slowly decentralized power, avoiding rupture.  

Would you risk repeating Kenya’s bloodshed for theoretical “plural incentives”?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our model prevents the very violence Kenya experienced by dismantling permanent exclusion. Ghana's peaceful alternation between NDC and NPP shows incentives for cross-ethnic appeals can become the norm. You cite "Kenya’s 2007 chaos" as a failure of alternation, but that was a failure of a dominant party system refusing to lose. The risk of perpetual majority rule is a guaranteed powder keg of resentment, while alternation offers a proven path to stability. The real risk is not change, but the explosive status quo.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The proposition's faith in forced alternation ignores institutional prerequisites for peaceful transitions. Ghana succeeded because it built strong electoral commissions and constitutional safeguards before alternation, not because alternation created those institutions. Their claim that Kenya's violence proved "dominant party systems refusing to lose" actually demonstrates our point: without robust institutions, any competitive transition triggers violence when stakes feel existential to ethnic groups. We minimize the worst outcome by insisting countries first establish democratic infrastructure, independent courts, and inclusive governance before engineering power shifts that history shows can explode into communal bloodshed.
