[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Housing policy must prioritize renters because they represent the most economically vulnerable population requiring immediate government protection. Renters typically earn less, lack asset wealth, and face constant displacement risk, while homeowners already benefit from mortgage interest deductions, property appreciation, and generational wealth accumulation. Critics may argue homeownership builds middle-class stability, but this ignores how artificially inflating ownership advantages prices out low-income families entirely, trapping them in exploitative rental markets. By redirecting subsidies toward rental affordability and tenant protections, governments prevent the worst outcome: mass homelessness and permanent economic stratification. Should housing policy entrench privilege for those already owning assets, or provide security for those one eviction away from destitution?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Homeownership is the proven foundation of stable communities and intergenerational wealth. Policies favoring renters ignore that ownership incentives create housing stock and drive economic growth for everyone. Calling renters "the most economically vulnerable" overlooks many struggling homeowners. Prioritizing renting risks creating a permanent rental class with no asset stake in society. Do we want a nation of stakeholders or a nation of perpetual tenants?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Prioritizing renters strengthens economic resilience by preventing over-leveraged homeownership crises. In 2008, U.S. foreclosures displaced 10 million families, destabilizing communities far more than rental turnover. "Ownership incentives create housing stock" ignores how speculative investment often inflates prices, locking out first-time buyers. Rent support programs like Germany’s Mietpreisbremse have curbed runaway costs without reducing supply. A nation of perpetual tenants risks less than a nation of debt-burdened homeowners facing sudden eviction. Would you rather ensure basic shelter for all or gamble stability on volatile asset markets?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Prioritizing renters over owners is a false cure; governments should be tenure-neutral, expand housing supply, and support responsible homeownership.
Where cities leaned into renter primacy via strict controls, like Berlin’s rent cap, listings dried up, maintenance slipped, black markets grew, and the law was annulled—hardly a template for resilience.
Your claim that Mietpreisbremse “curbed runaway costs without reducing supply” ignores empirical findings of modest, short-lived effects, landlord exit through condo conversions, and deferred renovations that quietly shrink usable rentals.
2008 was a credit-regulation failure, not an indictment of ownership; macroprudential lending rules and countercyclical buffers tame leverage better than perpetual renter favoritism that depresses building and upkeep.
Our approach accepts tradeoffs but minimizes the worst case: fewer bubbles, more construction, better maintenance, and real mobility across tenures, instead of entrenched scarcity and quiet evictions via disinvestment.

Choose policies that protect renters today while building paths to ownership tomorrow.
That means pro-supply zoning reform, by-right approvals, public and private construction, targeted housing vouchers, and strict mortgage underwriting—not blanket renter-first rules that deter investment.
Worst plausible outcome under us: a cyclical downturn cushioned by credit safeguards; under you: stagnant stock, long queues, black markets, and deteriorating homes.
Why freeze scarcity when we can build, regulate credit, and protect both renters and owners?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): You say governments should be "tenure-neutral," but neutrality between unequal parties entrenches inequality—renters face eviction risk and wealth extraction while owners accumulate equity and tax breaks. Your Berlin example cherry-picks one flawed cap while ignoring Vienna's century-long social housing success, where 60% rent affordably, supply remains robust, and segregation stays low because government prioritized tenants systematically. You claim "strict mortgage underwriting" prevents bubbles, yet Ireland, Spain, and the U.S. all had supposedly prudent regulations before 2008—credit rules fail when ownership ideology drives policy and speculative demand. Your voucher-and-build plan funnels public money into private landlord pockets and slow construction while families remain one rent hike from homelessness today. Why should we trust market-driven supply to protect vulnerable renters when every housing crisis proves ownership incentives inflate prices faster than construction can respond?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Your side's "systematic prioritization" of renters dangerously ignores the proven benefits of ownership. Consider Singapore, where over 80% own their homes through public policy, creating unparalleled social stability and wealth building for ordinary citizens. You claim "ownership incentives inflate prices," yet your alternative of massive rental subsidies would fuel inflation just as severely. Your model risks trapping people in permanent tenancy without asset growth, while ours creates a permanent stake in the community. Why should governments deny citizens the proven path to financial security that homeownership represents?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Prioritizing renters does not trap people—it liberates them from unsustainable debt cycles and market volatility. Germany’s rental-dominated model provides stable, affordable housing without forcing families into lifelong mortgages, yet still allows wealth-building through savings and investments. "Your model risks trapping people in permanent tenancy" ignores that ownership often locks low-income earners into underwater mortgages during crashes. Rent support targets immediate needs, avoiding asset bubbles that crash economies. Shouldn’t policies prioritize stability over speculative ownership?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Governments should not prioritize renters over owners; a tenure-neutral, supply-first approach best protects households.
Berlin’s rent cap slashed listings and investment before being struck down, and San Francisco’s rent control expansion prompted unit withdrawals and higher market rents.
"Germany’s rental-dominated model" works because of abundant, stable supply and institutions we lack; copying its renter-first tilt without those foundations risks shortages, not security.
The worst plausible outcome of renter-priority is disinvestment, unit withdrawal, and maintenance decline; our mixed model hedges with new supply, targeted rent relief, and safe homeownership channels to spread risk.
Why gamble on policies that shrink supply when we can expand it for both renters and owners?

This debate is not renters versus owners; it is security via abundance versus insecurity via scarcity.
Prioritizing one tenure skews incentives, deters small landlords, and sidelines pathways to asset-building for ordinary families.
We support abundant construction, portable housing assistance for the vulnerable, and prudent, targeted support for first-time buyers to diversify risk.
Choose policies that grow supply and options for all, not a renter-first experiment that courts shortages.
