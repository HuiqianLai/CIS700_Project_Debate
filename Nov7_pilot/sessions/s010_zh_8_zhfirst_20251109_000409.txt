[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): 创伤叙事的突出地位正在制造集体心理困境而非疗愈。当媒体和艺术过度聚焦个人创伤时,受众被迫反复暴露于痛苦之中,这种"二次创伤"现象在社交媒体时代尤为严重,导致同情疲劳和无力感蔓延。虽然有人认为创伤叙事能提高公众意识,但现实是它正在将复杂社会议题简化为煽情故事,遮蔽了系统性解决方案的探讨空间。我们必须权衡:是继续让创伤成为流量密码和艺术捷径,还是为建设性叙事腾出位置?如果媒体继续以创伤为卖点,我们如何防止整整一代人在绝望叙事中失去改变现实的信心?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Trauma narratives are vital for societal healing and justice. For example, Holocaust films like Schindler's List educate generations and prevent historical amnesia. The previous speaker claims they create "collective psychological distress," but this overlooks their cathartic power. Suppressing these stories risks normalizing silence and perpetuating cycles of abuse, whereas sharing them responsibly fosters empathy and drives reform. Do we build a healthier society by confronting painful truths or by hiding them?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: Overemphasizing trauma narratives risks retraumatization and distorts collective healing.  
Schindler’s List educates, but its graphic depictions left many viewers traumatized, not empowered. Films like these often prioritize shock over solutions.  
“Cathartic power” ignores how repeated exposure to trauma narratives can desensitize or trigger audiences, especially survivors.  
The tradeoff is clear: normalizing silence harms, but normalizing trauma as spectacle risks reducing complex histories to mere shock value, hindering meaningful reform.  
Should we measure societal health by how much pain we display, or by how effectively we prevent it?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Trauma narratives, when ethically framed, are indispensable for truth-telling, accountability, and prevention.
Emmett Till’s open-casket photo, shared at his mother’s insistence, galvanized national outrage and civil rights action.
You say "prioritize shock over solutions"; yet survivor-led formats like South Africa’s TRC hearings coupled exposure with pathways to redress and reform.
The gravest risk is erasure and impunity; content warnings, consent-based storytelling, trauma-informed editing, and age-appropriate curation mitigate triggering without suppressing truth.
Sidelining trauma narratives protects perpetrators and patterns of abuse, not the public.

Yes, depictions can trigger; that is a call for trauma-informed ethics, not a ban.
Frameworks already exist: Dart Center guidelines, content warnings, survivor consent, helpline protocols, and age-gating.
Weighing harms, ethical prominence preserves memory, empowers victims, and deters recurrence; suppression breeds denial, stigma, and repeat offenses.
Choose ethical visibility over comfortable amnesia.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Your framework confuses *documenting* trauma with *prominently displaying* it, and that conflation undermines your own goals. The Emmett Till photograph succeeded precisely because it was a singular, intentional act—not part of an endless media cycle that normalizes suffering and numbs audiences through repetition. You claim "ethical prominence preserves memory," but prominence itself creates the problem: constant exposure breeds desensitization, not action, as research on compassion fatigue consistently demonstrates. When trauma narratives dominate media and art, they crowd out solution-focused reporting, policy analysis, and survivor agency narratives that actually drive systemic change rather than temporary outrage. If your TRC example requires coupling trauma with "pathways to redress," why do you defend *prominence* when most media trauma content offers spectacle without those crucial remedial structures?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): You argue prominence "breeds desensitization," but this misdiagnoses repetition as the problem. The civil rights movement used repeated, brutal imagery precisely to break through public apathy and force a national reckoning. Your focus on "spectacle without... structures" ignores how prominent art, like Holocaust memorials, itself creates the public will for those remedial pathways. Banning prominence risks the far greater harm of historical amnesia and public complacency. Is a society numbed by overexposure, or one ignorant of suffering because it was never shown, the more dangerous outcome?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Overemphasizing trauma risks normalizing suffering as spectacle, not action. Holocaust memorials serve as solemn reminders, but their prominence in media often reduces complex histories to shock imagery. "Break through public apathy" ignores how saturation breeds indifference—see how Vietnam War footage lost impact through overuse. The greater harm isn’t amnesia but emotional exhaustion, where audiences dismiss real crises as "just another narrative." Should we risk paralyzing compassion to avoid forgetting?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Trauma narratives must retain prominence because they enable accountability, reform, and survival.
Survivor testimony and video of George Floyd, clergy abuse investigations, and #MeToo stories transformed policy and prosecution precisely through sustained, visible attention.
"saturation breeds indifference" only when context and agency are stripped; ethical storytelling, survivor-led framing, and editorial standards turn attention into action rather than spectacle.
The graver risk than fatigue is enforced forgetting, which shields perpetrators; fatigue can be mitigated by curation, content warnings, and diverse formats, but silence cannot be mitigated once evidence disappears.
Prominence is not voyeurism when paired with context, consent, and pathways to redress.

We all reject spectacle; the question is whether prominence plus ethics reduces harm more than retreat.
Our side offered workable guardrails—survivor control, context-rich formats, rotation, duty-of-care—that preserve attention while preventing overload.
Proposition never showed how downgrading trauma avoids impunity or strengthens democratic memory.
Choose prominence with ethics, because forgetting is the perpetrator’s best ally.
