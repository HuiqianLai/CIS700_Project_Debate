[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Comprehensive mode better serves patient needs than specialized mode. A study showed patients in comprehensive clinics had 30% fewer repeat visits as doctors addressed multiple issues at once. Opponents say "specialists provide deeper expertise." But fragmented care often misses connections between symptoms. Risks of misdiagnosis rise in专科模式 as specialists may overlook broader health contexts. Why prioritize narrow expertise over holistic, patient-centered care?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): 专科模式更优，因为在高风险和复杂疾病上它更安全、更有效。
如急性卒中、ST段抬高心梗、早期癌症，专科中心依托专门训练与流程，缩短诊疗时效、提高正确率、减少不可逆伤害。
对方说“30% fewer repeat visits”，但复诊次数不是结局指标，复杂病需要计划性复诊以保证用药调试与并发症监测。
我们承认通科的连续性价值，但可以通过多学科会诊、共享病历、规范转诊把专科整合起来，同时避免把罕见/危重病当作“小问题”的致命延误。
在风险对比中，漏诊或延误重症的代价远大于增加一次转诊的麻烦。

把小病一次看完很方便，但最糟的是把重大疾病看漏或看晚。
专科以分级、质控与团队协作，系统性降低此类灾难性错误。
同时，用家庭医生把关与MDT会诊，专科同样能提供整体性与连续性。
面对不确定的健康风险，选择能最小化最坏后果的体系：优先专科，整合协同。
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponent concedes continuity matters but claims specialist handoffs can replicate it—that assumption fails in practice. When patients shuttle between cardiologists, endocrinologists, and nephrologists, no single clinician tracks cumulative drug interactions, contraindications, or whether imaging was already done elsewhere, leading to polypharmacy and duplicated tests. The claim that "MDT meetings and shared records" solve fragmentation ignores that most health systems lack real-time integration, and busy specialists rarely attend weekly case conferences for routine comorbidities. Regarding "catastrophic misses," generalists refer suspected strokes and MIs immediately—the question is whether every headache or chest pain justifies specialist triage, because over-referral floods emergency departments and delays true emergencies. Specialist excellence in narrow diseases does not outweigh the harms of uncoordinated care for the majority who live with multiple chronic conditions simultaneously. If coordination infrastructure is the fix, why not invest it in training generalists who already see the whole patient rather than patching silos that inherently divide care?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our system prevents dangerous delays for complex diseases. Specialists possess the deep expertise to correctly diagnose rare or severe conditions that generalists might miss. They claim "over-referral floods emergency departments," but misdiagnosis is the greater floodgate. A delayed cancer or autoimmune diagnosis from a generalist has irreversible consequences, far outweighing temporary triage burdens. Why is it acceptable to risk missing a critical diagnosis for the sake of initial coordination?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Comprehensive care minimizes misdiagnosis risks through coordinated, iterative care rather than isolated specialist judgment. A generalist in a integrated system identified early-stage ovarian cancer missed by two specialists focused narrowly on gastrointestinal symptoms, catching it before metastasis. "Delayed cancer diagnosis from generalists" ignores how specialists often see only fragments—generalists track evolving patterns. The tradeoff isn't between coordination and accuracy; coordinated generalists reduce diagnostic gaps by maintaining longitudinal patient relationships. Why assume specialists working in silos are inherently safer than connected generalists with full context?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): 我们反对通科优先，因为在时间敏感与高复杂度情境下，专科体系更安全。 
急性卒中、ST段抬高心梗、重度创伤与宫外孕破裂，需要专科团队与设备即时介入，通科“协调”无法替代取栓、导管介入或紧急外科的决定性治疗。 
你声称“coordinated generalists reduce diagnostic gaps”，但专科早已通过MDT与胸痛/卒中/创伤绿色通道实现整合，且拥有终止性治疗能力。 
权衡风险，通科的最糟结局是误转与迟转错过治疗窗；专科网络以标准流程、明确主责与24/7覆盖降低尾部风险。 
面对疑似大血管闭塞，你主张先由通科“纵向跟踪”，还是直送有取栓能力的专科中心？

单一轶事无法推翻专科的系统性可靠性，我们应以机制而非偶然取胜。 
专科并非“孤岛”，真正的安全来自专科主导的跨学科路径与明确把关。 
当时间就是器官时，延误不可逆，能力缺口比信息碎片更致命。 
最坏风险最小化=把复杂与急危重症交给专科，通科做首诊与转运。
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponents defend specialist silos by invoking time-critical emergencies, yet ignore that most hospital presentations are undifferentiated, multi-morbid, or frailty-driven conditions where generalist coordination prevents fragmentation and iatrogenic harm. They claim "specialist networks already integrate through MDT," but green pathways serve only protocol-eligible patients while leaving complex elderly, diagnostic uncertainty, and post-discharge continuity to fall through cracks that comprehensive generalists systematically close. Yes, acute stroke needs thrombectomy—but the majority of admissions involve diagnostic ambiguity, polypharmacy risk, and cross-system needs where specialist tunnels vision causes delayed recognition of alternative diagnoses, medication errors, and readmissions that generalist oversight demonstrably reduces. The real trade-off is this: specialists excel at definitive interventions but create coordination failure and safety gaps across the patient journey, while generalists minimize systemic risk through holistic oversight, continuous accountability, and adaptive triage that catches what protocols miss.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The proposition's model dangerously downplays the necessity of expert-led care. For complex diseases like cancer or heart failure, immediate specialist intervention saves lives and prevents irreversible decline. They claim generalists "minimize systemic risk," but this ignores the catastrophic risks of delayed diagnosis and outdated treatment. When minutes or precise knowledge matter, a system prioritizing general oversight inevitably fails its sickest patients. Ultimately, patient safety is best served by ensuring the most expert hands are in charge from the start.
