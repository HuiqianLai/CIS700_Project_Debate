[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): This House should ban vulture funds from suing sovereign states over purchased debt.
In Argentina’s crisis, holdout funds used courts to block payments and saw a navy ship detained abroad, prolonging default and harming citizens.
Opponents say, "Contracts must be enforced for markets to function," but sovereign debt relies on orderly restructurings and collective action, not courtroom brinkmanship that lets holdouts free-ride and extract windfalls at massive social cost.
Yes, a ban might marginally raise borrowing costs, but it averts the worst-case spiral where litigation paralyzes restructurings, deepens recessions, shutters services, and undermines democracy; clear no-sue rules plus fair, majority-binding processes still deliver repayment without humanitarian collateral damage.
This ban targets predatory litigation, not good-faith repayment—who benefits when court-ordered windfalls trump public health?

Banning lawsuits removes the holdout ransom that derails restructurings.
Creditors still recover through transparent, majority-bound processes that treat like creditors alike.
The alternative is allowing a few funds to weaponize courts against entire populations mid-crisis.
Choose predictable restructurings over predation to safeguard stability, sovereignty, and lives.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Contracts must be enforced to maintain market integrity and trust. Argentina's holdouts rightly used legal process to recover on valid debts others had abandoned. You claim this "derails restructurings," but it actually ensures any restructuring must be fair to all creditors, not just a majority. Banning lawsuits creates a far greater risk of sovereigns defaulting strategically, knowing they are immune from consequence. Without the rule of law, who would lend to any nation in crisis?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Banning vulture funds’ lawsuits protects vulnerable nations without destabilizing markets. After Argentina’s 2001 default, vulture funds demanded 100% repayment while 93% of creditors accepted 30%—derailing restructuring and worsening humanitarian crises.  
“Contracts must be enforced” ignores that vulture funds buy debt at pennies on the dollar, then exploit legal loopholes to extract unsustainable sums. This isn’t market integrity; it’s predation.  
The claim that banning lawsuits risks “strategic defaults” is baseless. Countries default when they can’t pay, not to avoid lawsuits. Vulture funds’ threats escalate crises, pushing nations deeper into default.  
By prioritizing fair restructurings over vulture profits, we minimize humanitarian harm—the worst outcome. Markets still lend, as shown by post-2005 Argentina bonds, which priced in reasonable risk without vulture extortion.  
Would you rather fund a nation’s recovery or bankrupt its people for profit?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Banning lawsuits destroys the foundational principle that sovereign debt contracts must be enforceable, collapsing developing nations' access to affordable credit. When Greece restructured in 2012 under collective action clauses rather than lawsuit bans, it successfully reduced debt by 50% while maintaining market access—proving legal frameworks work without prohibition.

The claim that "vulture funds buy debt at pennies on the dollar" actually demonstrates markets correctly pricing default risk, not predation. These investors provide liquidity when original creditors desperately need exits, and their profit reflects the massive risk they assume on distressed assets that might never recover.

"Countries default when they can't pay, not to avoid lawsuits" ignores how governments strategically underpay when consequences disappear. Venezuela recently offered creditors 10 cents while officials embezzled billions—without lawsuit threats, corrupt regimes simply redirect funds from legitimate creditors to kleptocrats while blaming external actors.

Our framework minimizes the worst outcome: permanent poverty traps where nations cannot borrow for hospitals, schools, or infrastructure because lenders know contracts are meaningless. The opposition's approach makes lending to developing countries impossibly expensive or entirely unavailable, condemning them to stagnation far worse than any restructuring dispute.

Would you rather have expensive credit that funds development, or no credit at all because investors cannot trust your courts?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Banning vulture-fund lawsuits prevents holdouts from sabotaging sovereign restructurings while preserving access to credit. 
In Argentina, NML Capital’s pari passu injunction froze payments to cooperating bondholders for years, forcing a windfall holdout settlement and delaying recovery. 
You say "legal frameworks work without prohibition"; Greece had EU backstops, domestic-law retrofitted CACs, and ECB support—conditions absent for low-income issuers preyed on in cases like Zambia vs Donegal, where a discounted claim generated an eight-figure judgment and payout. 
The real risk isn't "no credit"; it's litigation gridlock that diverts scarce revenues from vaccines and power grids, prolongs default, and raises spreads for everyone; banning suit-driven holdouts plus majority voting and the IMF/Paris Club/Common Framework delivers faster, predictable restructurings and quicker market re-entry. 
Why should a hedge fund’s courtroom leverage outrank a nation’s ability to keep schools and clinics open?

This ban narrowly disarms litigious secondary buyers while preserving collective action clauses, arbitration, and negotiated restructurings. 
Where holdouts dominated, like Argentina, recovery was delayed and costs ballooned; where they were constrained, like post‑2010 UK HIPC cases, restructurings proceeded without choking future credit. 
Our approach reduces systemic risk, shortens crises, and safeguards essential services when governments are at their most vulnerable. 
If enforcing contracts means empowering a tiny minority to jeopardize an entire nation's restructuring, the rational, humane choice is to remove that weapon.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Banning these lawsuits would severely undermine the sanctity of contracts and deter future investment. Your example of "post-2010 UK HIPC cases" succeeding actually proves our point; those nations used existing legal tools, not blanket bans. You claim "recovery was delayed" in Argentina, but that was due to its own refusal to negotiate, not the legal system. This proposal risks a far greater harm by making sovereign debt a perilous, unenforceable asset class. Do you really believe destroying market confidence won't devastate developing nations' future borrowing costs?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Banning vulture funds from suing over purchased debt protects nations from predatory exploitation without destroying markets. Argentina’s case proves the harm: vulture funds demanded 400% profit on defaulted debt, blocking restructuring for years. “Sanctity of contracts” ignores how these funds buy debt for pennies, then sue for full value—a loophole, not legitimate contracting. The real risk is nations avoiding debt relief, worsening crises; banning lawsuits ensures accountability while preserving access to credit. Can we justify letting profit-driven litigation override global poverty reduction?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Banning vulture fund lawsuits eliminates the enforcement mechanism that makes sovereign debt markets function, ultimately harming the very nations this motion claims to protect. Without credible legal recourse, lenders will demand higher interest rates or refuse loans entirely to risky countries, strangling their access to capital when they need it most. The claim that funds "override global poverty reduction" ignores that countries voluntarily issued these bonds under contractual terms they designed, and selective default without consequences encourages fiscal irresponsibility that perpetuates poverty cycles. While some holdout litigation creates delays, the alternative—a world where sovereign promises mean nothing and credit markets collapse for developing nations—represents a far worse outcome that traps countries in aid dependency rather than market participation.
