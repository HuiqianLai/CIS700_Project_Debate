[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The "dual-speed Church" policy allows tailored pastoral care for regions with differing spiritual needs. In Africa, where Catholic growth outpaces Europe, localized strategies foster evangelization. Critics argue "it risks division," but unity doesn’t demand uniformity. Risks like resource imbalance are manageable through clear oversight and shared goals. Would rejecting adaptation mean failing to meet souls where they are?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): The Holy See should reject a "dual-speed Church" because it institutionalizes inequality and invites fragmentation. 
When "local speeds" were tacitly tolerated after Vatican II, liturgical experimentation bred confusion and mistrust until Rome reestablished common norms through the revised Missal and clarifications. 
Yes, "unity doesn’t demand uniformity", but a policy that labels communities fast or slow on core pastoral discipline signals different standards, eroding universality and creating de facto parallel magisteria. 
The worst plausible outcome of dual speeds is entrenched regional doctrines and schism; the worst on our path is slower adaptation, mitigated by targeted inculturation within shared norms, which preserves communion while still meeting local needs. 
Assurances of oversight underestimate incentives: fast-lane regions will attract talent and funds, breed status competition, and pressure others to conform, a race dynamic no supervisory memo can neutralize.

We can deliver adaptation through existing means: ad experimentum permissions with firm sunset clauses, clearer inculturation norms, and universal doctrinal guardrails before any local practice becomes law. 
Tie resources to demonstrable need and fruitfulness, not "speed," and require intercontinental peer review of major pastoral innovations to avoid isolated experiments becoming parallel standards. 
This path minimizes the highest-stakes harm—fracture of communion—while still enabling growth and zeal where the Church is most vibrant. 
Choose one Church with many cultures, not two classes of Catholics.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition's own example proves dual-speed is necessary, not dangerous. They cite Vatican II liturgical reforms that eventually succeeded through experimentation and revision, demonstrating that managed pluralism produces better universal norms than rigid uniformity imposed from the start. Their claim that "fast-lane regions will attract talent and funds" actually reveals the status quo problem: vibrant churches already draw resources while ossified structures hemorrhage members in regions clinging to outdated pastoral methods that Rome hesitates to override.

The opposition says dual speeds create "parallel magisteria," but existing Canon Law already permits episcopal conferences substantial autonomy on liturgical language, marriage preparation protocols, and catechetical approaches without fracturing communion. Their proposed alternative of "ad experimentum permissions with sunset clauses" is dual-speed policy by another name, merely hiding intentional differentiation behind procedural language while adding bureaucratic delay that costs souls.

The worst outcome they fear, schism, historically arises from suppressing legitimate local pastoral needs until frustration explodes, as seen when Latin rigidity pushed Protestant reformers away, not from officially acknowledging different readiness levels. Their slower universal path guarantees the actual highest-stakes harm: continued mass exodus in secularizing regions where the Church appears irrelevant while mission territories wait decades for contextually appropriate evangelization methods.

If your approach already permits differentiated experiments, why oppose formalizing transparency and accountability through explicit dual-speed structures?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our opponents fundamentally misrepresent the nature of Church unity. Their comparison to Vatican II's liturgical reform is flawed, as those were universal experiments aimed at a single, renewed rite, not creating permanent separate tracks. They claim "suppressing local needs causes schism," but history shows formalizing division, like the Orthodox schism, starts with establishing parallel structures. A two-speed model institutionalizes inequality, making the slower lane feel like second-class members of the Body of Christ. Do you truly believe creating a permanent ecclesial underclass fosters the universal call to holiness?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The "dual-speed" model does not institutionalize inequality but addresses diverse pastoral realities. After Vatican II, the Church allowed vernacular liturgies without schism, showing flexibility can coexist with unity. "Formalizing division starts with parallel structures" ignores that dual-speed is temporary, not permanent. Risks of stagnation without adaptation outweigh hypothetical division; local contexts demand tailored solutions. Does refusing adaptability truly uphold unity, or risk irrelevance?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): The dual-speed policy institutionalizes inequality and corrodes communion. 
Where parallel tracks emerged, polarization grew: Germany’s Synodal Path and divergent blessing practices forced Rome to issue clarifications, revealing how localized accelerations strain universal discipline. 
You say "temporary, not permanent"; but indults often ossify—Communion in the hand and regional norms became de facto universals. 
Adaptation’s upside is real, but the worst plausible downside is doctrinal incoherence and rival authorities; one-speed reform with ad experimentum pilots, firm sunset clauses, and universal reception minimizes that risk. 
If flexibility suffices, why create a branded two-tier system at all?

Unity with subsidiarity requires one magisterial timeline, not parallel lanes. 
Use tightly bounded experiments under Rome’s mandate, evaluated publicly, then universally adopted or discontinued. 
This preserves pastoral creativity while preventing identity drift and market-style competition between churches. 
Choose reforms that bind us together, not speeds that pull us apart.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The dual-speed policy preserves universal communion precisely by accommodating legitimate diversity rather than forcing premature uniformity that breeds resentment and schism. Our opponent warns "parallel lanes" create division, yet history proves the opposite: forced one-speed mandates from Vatican I sparked Old Catholic breakaways, while Eastern Catholic Churches retain distinct disciplines within full communion, demonstrating that differentiated practices strengthen rather than fracture unity. You claim "ad experimentum pilots" suffice, but your model still requires some regions to wait indefinitely while Rome deliberates, whereas our framework grants immediate pastoral relief under magisterial oversight with built-in accountability through periodic review and reintegration pathways. The worst plausible outcome is not managed flexibility but rigid uniformity that ignores pastoral emergencies, driving frustrated communities toward actual schism as we witnessed with Lefebvrite traditionalists who rejected even legitimate development. Unity means walking together at different paces toward the same destination, not forcing the elderly and youth to march in lockstep until the slower collapse.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): This policy fundamentally redefines the Church as a mere federation. Our strongest evidence is that a "two-speed" model institutionalizes inequality, creating second-class members. They claim "differentiated practices strengthen unity," but this confuses uniformity with the unity of a single body. The worst outcome is a structurally divided Church, not a patiently discerning one. We must choose organic development over a permanent schism.
