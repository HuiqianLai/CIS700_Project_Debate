[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Art's value lies in its capacity to evoke unique emotional and cultural responses, making subjectivity its core strength. Van Gogh's "Starry Night" divides critics—some see genius, others chaos—proving no objective standard can capture its impact. Opponents may claim "objective criteria ensure consistency," but rigid rules stifle innovation and ignore diverse human experiences. Prioritizing subjectivity risks occasional misinterpretation but preserves art's role as a mirror for society's evolving voices, whereas objectivity risks reducing it to a checklist. Can art truly inspire if we force it into a one-size-fits-all mold?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Objective standards are essential for art to have any lasting cultural or educational value. Consider art restoration: we objectively analyze pigments and brushstrokes to preserve a masterpiece's integrity for future generations. They claim "rigid rules stifle innovation," but foundational technique enables true creative freedom. Subjectivity risks cultural amnesia, where masterpieces are lost to passing trends, while objectivity provides a stable framework for artistic legacy. Without shared standards, how can we distinguish profound art from mere decoration?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The opponent conflates technical preservation with aesthetic judgment, fundamentally misunderstanding our motion. Art restoration uses objective methods to preserve physical materials, but this says nothing about whether the artwork itself possesses objective beauty or meaning—restorers preserve what exists, not what is "good."

They claim "shared standards" prevent cultural amnesia, yet history shows the opposite: objective gatekeepers dismissed Impressionism, Jazz, and Van Gogh as worthless. Rigid standards don't preserve great art; they actively suppress innovation until subjective appreciation eventually overrides dogmatic rejection.

The opponent asks how we "distinguish profound art from mere decoration" without objective rules, revealing their elitist assumption. This gatekeeping mentality has historically excluded entire cultures whose art didn't match Western academic standards, erasing diverse voices rather than protecting legacy.

The real risk isn't that subjectivity loses masterpieces—it's that objectivity enshrines mediocrity by elevating technically correct works while marginalizing revolutionary art that challenges conventions. We've seen this pattern destroy countless artists' careers only for later generations to recognize their genius.

If objective standards reliably identified great art, why do expert consensus and market values shift so dramatically across decades?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Predominantly objective evaluation of art better safeguards fairness, education, and cultural memory.
Across cultures, stable criteria—craft accuracy, compositional coherence, and originality within constraints—let us tell a competent raga from a botched one, a masterful ukiyo-e print from a clumsy copy; conservators and juries likewise weigh integrity and intent, beyond anyone’s taste.
You say "objective gatekeepers dismissed Impressionism"; that failure indicts institutions, not objectivity—later acceptance rested on articulated criteria of light, perception, and method that justify the shift beyond "I like it".
If quality is mostly subjective, curation, funding, and curricula drift toward popularity and outrage; our side offers plural, revisable, transparent standards that let innovators justify departures while protecting minority traditions against majoritarian taste.
Without standards, on what grounds do we defend Van Gogh against both 19th-century academies and today’s algorithm?

Objective evaluation isn’t dogma; it is a corrigible framework that makes reasons public and errors visible.
Reappraisals of Jazz and Impressionism relied on new criteria—rhythm, timbre, light, perception—not mere fashion.
Predominant subjectivity maximizes volatility and hands culture to markets and algorithms; objective pluralism yields accountability, teachability, and durability.
Prefer standards we can argue and improve over tastes we can only assert.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Claim: Subjectivity does not preclude accountability but fosters dynamic cultural evolution that objectivity’s rigid frameworks often resist.  
Van Gogh’s rejection by 19th-century academies—rooted in their “articulated criteria”—shows how objective standards stifle innovation, while subjective shifts later embraced his genius.  
You argue “objective pluralism yields accountability,” yet institutions clinging to outdated criteria (e.g., academic painting) delayed justice for artists like Van Gogh.  
Risk: Objective frameworks risk entrenching power structures; subjectivity’s volatility is mitigated by collective discourse, ensuring no single taste dominates indefinitely.  
If objectivity is so “revisable,” why did it take decades to correct Van Gogh’s fate? Subjectivity’s messiness better reflects culture’s living nature.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Your example of Van Gogh actually proves objectivity's necessity, not its failure. His posthumous recognition relied on objective analysis of his technique's influence and formal innovations. You claim "objectivity’s rigid frameworks resist" change, but this misrepresents objective critique. Objective standards are revisable through new evidence and collective reasoning, preventing permanent entrenchment. Without objective anchors, how do we distinguish genuine innovation from mere novelty?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our case stands because subjectivity empowers diverse voices while objectivity inevitably concentrates gatekeeping power. When we embrace art's subjective nature, we prevent cultural stagnation by allowing marginalized perspectives to challenge dominant narratives without seeking permission from established authorities. The opposition claims "objective standards are revisable through new evidence," but this misses the fundamental point: who decides what counts as valid evidence or legitimate innovation? The worst outcome of objectivity is cultural homogenization where entire traditions are dismissed as inferior, while subjectivity's risk of varied opinions is democracy itself, not a flaw.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Predominantly objective evaluation of art best safeguards excellence, fairness, and cultural memory.
Blind auditions in orchestras expanded diversity by centering measurable performance quality.
They ask, "who decides what counts as valid evidence?"—plural, transparent rubrics, rotating juries, and blind review distribute authority and require reasons on record, inviting challenge.
Objectivity risks gatekeeping; pure subjectivity invites attention-market capture, fads, fraud, and heritage erosion; transparent, revisable standards minimize the worst by checking power, enabling appeals, and protecting communities and works.
Without shared criteria, marginalized innovators get dismissed as mere "preference," weakening claims to resources, preservation, and education.

This debate is about how we arbitrate value under disagreement and power.
Proposition never explained how subjective "democracy" resists algorithmic markets, fraud, or appropriation without attribution.
Our model accepts revisable standards and diverse canons, but demands reasons, comparability, and remedies.
Choose predominantly objective evaluation because transparent criteria empower challenge, broaden inclusion, and safeguard culture.
