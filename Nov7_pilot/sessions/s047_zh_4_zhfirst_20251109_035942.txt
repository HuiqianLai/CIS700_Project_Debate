[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Intellectual property law's internationalization harms domestic innovation and sovereignty. Developing nations face coercive pressure to adopt strict IP regimes, stifling local industries. Critics argue "global standards foster creativity," but this ignores how rigid rules block access to essential technologies. The risks of cultural homogenization and economic exploitation outweigh theoretical benefits. Why should nations sacrifice self-determination for corporate-driven uniformity?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): International IP frameworks protect creators everywhere and foster global collaboration. They enable inventors in developing nations to secure royalties worldwide, as seen with India's thriving generic drug and software industries. The previous speaker claims "rigid rules block access," but treaties include flexibilities for public health and emergencies. Without shared standards, piracy would destroy the incentive to create, harming all nations. Shouldn't we protect the individual innovator's rights across borders?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): International IP harmonization entrenches monopoly power, raising prices and slowing diffusion, especially in health and green tech.
When Thailand issued compulsory licenses for key medicines, the USTR escalated trade pressure and Abbott pulled new drug applications in 2007—flexibilities existed on paper, but punishment followed.
You claim “treaties include flexibilities for public health”; yet TRIPS‑plus data exclusivity and retaliation chill their use, and COVID‑19’s stalled waiver proved how politics blocks timely access.
Even if shared standards curb some piracy, the worst-case under harmonization is preventable deaths and knowledge apartheid; decentralized regimes with robust exceptions, compulsory licensing, open licensing, and prize/public funding protect creation while prioritizing access.
If international IP truly empowers the Global South, why were mRNA know‑how and technology transfer withheld despite vast public investment and global need?

Harmonization exports the strongest monopolies into the weakest markets.
Its promised flexibilities are routinely narrowed by TRIPS‑plus deals and coercive enforcement.
A plural, development‑first IP order yields innovation and access, reducing the gravest harms.
Choose rules that maximize lives saved and knowledge shared, not rents protected.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Harmonization does not export monopolies; it establishes predictable rules that enable technology transfer and collaborative research across borders, which fragmented systems cannot achieve.

The opponent highlights Thailand's compulsory licensing case, but omits that TRIPS Article 31 flexibilities have been successfully invoked in India, Brazil, and Rwanda without crippling retaliation, and generic antiretrovirals now reach millions precisely because harmonized standards let manufacturers scale across multiple markets simultaneously.

You claim "flexibilities are routinely narrowed," yet the 2001 Doha Declaration explicitly reaffirmed compulsory licensing rights, and India's thriving generics industry operates within TRIPS while supplying 50% of global vaccines—harmonization created the legal certainty that enabled this life-saving capacity.

The real worst-case under fragmentation is what we saw pre-TRIPS: no enforceable standards meant innovators withheld cutting-edge medicines and technologies from entire regions, fearing total appropriation, whereas harmonized minimum protections with built-in exceptions incentivize both R&D investment and legitimate generic competition simultaneously.

If decentralized regimes truly maximize access, why did vaccine production concentrate in harmonized IP jurisdictions with contract enforcement, while countries lacking such frameworks struggled to attract any technology transfer partnerships during COVID-19?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Harmonization's supposed "flexibilities" are illusory when TRIPS-plus agreements erode them.  
The EU-India FTA draft required data exclusivity, blocking generics despite TRIPS Article 31—proof that harmonization can override exceptions.  
"Harmonized standards let manufacturers scale" ignores how TRIPS-plus terms in bilateral deals restrict production to patent holders.  
Fragmented systems let countries tailor protections; harmonization risks global lock-in of corporate-friendly terms, worsening access for the poor.  
If harmonization truly balanced rights, why do 70% of low-income countries face TRIPS-plus pressures that limit compulsory licensing?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): You claim harmonization "overrides exceptions" like compulsory licensing. Yet international law enabled Brazil's HIV program via local production under TRIPS flexibilities. Your EU-India draft example ignores that India rejected those terms, proving sovereignty remains. Harmonization sets a floor, not a ceiling, for protection. Without this baseline, wouldn't the weakest nations face even greater bilateral pressure?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Internationalizing IP entrenches monopoly power and chills lifesaving access and innovation in poorer countries.
COVID-19 showed it: a modest TRIPS waiver stalled for two years while data exclusivity and secrecy blocked scale-up, and Jordan’s FTA-driven exclusivity once kept generics off the market despite patents expiring.
Your "sets a floor, not a ceiling" ignores TRIPS‑plus treaties, Special 301 blacklists, and dispute threats that ratchet the floor upward and deter compulsory licensing even when legal.
Even if harmonization yields some certainty, the worst plausible outcome is delayed medicines and suppressed local R&D; devolved, development-led flexibility with cooperation minimizes that catastrophe—do we accept predictable contracts at the price of preventable deaths?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): International IP harmonization is the only scalable path to deliver innovation equitably across borders while preserving sovereign flexibility. The Prop's COVID example actually proves our point: the delay stemmed from fragmented national vetoes and bilateral political bargaining, not from TRIPS itself, which explicitly permits compulsory licensing and emergency use. Their claim that "TRIPS-plus treaties ratchet the floor upward" ignores that multilateral frameworks like Doha and the Paris Agreement embed safeguards precisely because harmonization creates forums where developing countries negotiate collectively with real leverage. Fragmentation guarantees the worst outcome—powerful nations impose terms bilaterally on weaker partners with zero transparency, while researchers and patients lose cross-border collaboration that accelerates cures; would Prop rather negotiate alone against trade sanctions, or within a rules-based system that at least makes coercion visible and contestable?
