[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Closer ties with China are fundamentally in Taiwan's economic and security interests. Economic integration provides Taiwanese businesses unparalleled access to the vast mainland market, ensuring continued prosperity. Opponents claim this "surrenders our autonomy," but this misrepresents mutual benefit for mutual isolation. The greatest risk is instability, which our approach minimizes through dialogue and shared growth. Is continued prosperity not a superior path to the perils of confrontation?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Pursuing friendlier ties with Beijing endangers Taiwan’s autonomy and security.
China weaponizes trade: punitive bans on Australian wine, South Korea’s Lotte over THAAD, Lithuania’s exports—and Taiwan’s pineapples and grouper—show integration becomes coercive leverage.
You claim "The greatest risk is instability," yet engagement never stopped missile deployments or gray-zone incursions, and Hong Kong proves promises of autonomy erode under closer ties.
The worst plausible outcome is peaceful coercion—economic dependence forcing political concessions without war; we minimize it by diversifying markets, hardening supply chains, and engaging China conditionally with guardrails, not deepening asymmetrical ties.
Why trade short-term gains for leverage Beijing can weaponize at will?

Taiwan thrives by preserving strategic autonomy, not by deepening dependence on a coercive neighbor.
Economic openness should be diversified, rules-based, and resilient, so no single actor can squeeze us.
Engage China, yes—but on bounded, verifiable terms that resist political linkage and retaliation.
Security through leverage-proof prosperity beats prosperity contingent on compliance.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponents concede that engagement with China is necessary, yet their guardrails strategy has already failed. The current approach of conditional engagement and diversification has not prevented Beijing from escalating military pressure or isolating Taiwan diplomatically, proving that strategic autonomy without meaningful dialogue simply invites confrontation. 

They claim "engagement never stopped missile deployments," but correlation is not causation: cross-strait hostility peaked precisely when ties weakened under Chen Shui-bian and recently under Tsai, while the Ma era saw zero PLA incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and direct communication channels that prevented miscalculation. Lithuania and Australia faced retaliation because they lack Taiwan's unique leverage as an irreplaceable technology hub and geographic keystone China needs for reunification legitimacy, not conquest.

The opposition's diversification plan cannot escape geography: 40% of Taiwan's exports go to Greater China because proximity, language, and supply chain integration create structural advantages no amount of hedging erases, and attempting forced decoupling destroys Taiwanese businesses while Beijing simply sources elsewhere. Their worst-case scenario of peaceful coercion ignores that Taiwan already possesses coercive immunity through semiconductor dominance and U.S. security guarantees, meaning engagement from a position of strength extracts concessions rather than grants them.

If strategic autonomy without dialogue worked, why has Taiwan's international space shrunk to 13 diplomatic allies while cross-strait tension reached 40-year highs under the current approach?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Pursuing friendlier ties with China risks entrenching Taiwan’s subordination while undermining its international legitimacy.  
Under Ma Ying-jeou’s “three links,” cross-strait economic dependency surged, yet Beijing never paused military drills or political coercion—proving engagement doesn’t buy security.  
“Taiwan’s semiconductor dominance grants coercive immunity” ignores reality: China’s 2020 economic retaliation against Australia, despite its iron ore leverage, shows Beijing will punish perceived disloyalty regardless of cost.  
Proximity-driven trade ties force Taiwan into a vulnerable position where economic interdependence becomes a tool for political leverage, not mutual benefit—diversification, however gradual, reduces this existential risk.  
Can Taiwan afford to bet its sovereignty on Beijing’s “goodwill” when its history shows conditional engagement only deepens dependency without yielding political concessions?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your claim that engagement "doesn't buy security" ignores the alternative. Hostility guarantees military pressure, while dialogue opens channels to manage crises. Australia's case differs entirely; it lacks the profound cultural and familial bonds that temper cross-strait relations. You argue economic ties create "political leverage," yet severing them invites immediate and severe economic shock. Is it wiser to de-escalate tensions through friendship or accept permanent militarization? Our approach builds the trust necessary to prevent the worst outcome: conflict.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Friendlier ties on Beijing’s terms increase Taiwan’s vulnerability, not security.
Hong Kong had denser economic, cultural, and familial links—yet Beijing imposed the National Security Law and dismantled promised autonomy.
You cite “cultural and familial bonds”; those ties did not temper coercion in Hong Kong or during China’s bans on Taiwan’s pineapples and grouper.
Deep “friendship” creates dependency Beijing can weaponize; calibrated deterrence, supply-chain diversification, and precondition-free hotlines better manage crises while denying leverage.
If trust is the shield, why did China escalate live-fire drills after Taiwan’s elections despite existing dialogue channels?

Our path: diversify trade, strengthen civil defense and alliances, and maintain narrow, transparent crisis-communication lines.
It minimizes war risk while reducing peacetime coercion capacity.
Their plan bets on goodwill despite repeated coercion—ECFA threats, tourism throttling, and targeted embargoes.
Real security comes from resilience plus deterrence, not deepening dependencies Beijing has already shown it will weaponize.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Taiwan's security depends on reducing tensions that invite catastrophic conflict, not building walls that guarantee it. Our opponent's strategy of deterrence and diversification cannot eliminate the fundamental reality that war across the Taiwan Strait would devastate twenty-four million people regardless of who wins militarily. They claim "real security comes from resilience plus deterrence," but deterrence without dialogue is how the Cuban Missile Crisis nearly ended civilization—only back-channel communication prevented annihilation. Yes, Beijing has coerced Taiwan economically, but complete separation ensures those disputes escalate to military confrontation instead of remaining manageable economic friction; trading pineapple bans for missile barrages is not rational risk management.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Pursuing friendlier ties with China does not guarantee Taiwan's security—it risks surrendering autonomy for false promises. Beijing's "friendship" comes with strings: Hong Kong's erosion of freedoms under "one country, two systems" proves this model's failure. "Trading pineapple bans for missile barrages" ignores that concessions incentivize further coercion, not de-escalation. The worst outcome—invasion—is minimized by deterrence and global alliances, while closer ties normalize Beijing's claims, making conflict more likely. Can Taiwan afford to bet its future on a power that denies its existence?
