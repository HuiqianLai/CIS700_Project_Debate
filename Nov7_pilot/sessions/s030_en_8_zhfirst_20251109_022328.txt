[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Immortality offers humanity the ultimate freedom from our greatest fear: death. Imagine mastering countless skills and witnessing centuries of human progress firsthand. They claim "immortality leads to overpopulation," but this ignores human ingenuity. The risk of a finite life is irreversible loss, while we can solve future challenges together. Do you truly believe a short, fleeting life is preferable to an eternity of potential?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Immortality would trap the average person in an existence of profound psychological suffering and stagnation. Human meaning derives from mortality—we cherish relationships, pursue goals, and create art precisely because our time is limited. The proposition claims we can "solve future challenges together," but immortality guarantees watching everyone you love die repeatedly, enduring endless grief that compounds over centuries. The worst outcome isn't death itself, but an inescapable eternity where boredom, trauma, and loss accumulate without relief or renewal. Would you truly choose to watch your children, grandchildren, and every friend you ever make grow old and die while you remain unchanged?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Immortality is preferable because it maximizes agency, option value, and the capacity to adapt.
Consider real lives: widows remarry, bereaved parents mentor others, refugees rebuild communities; humans repeatedly transform grief into new bonds, projects, and identities.
You claim "meaning derives from mortality"; in fact, meaning arises from engagement, goals, and relationships, which mortality can catalyze but immortality expands by giving endless opportunities to learn, love, and contribute.
Grief doesn’t compound indefinitely; memory reconsolidation and human neuroplasticity blunt pain over time, and new intergenerational communities form, so the claim of inevitable stagnation assumes psychological stasis that contradicts how people actually grow.
Between certain extinction and survivable hardship with limitless option value, rational preference is immortality.

Immortality doesn’t freeze you; it frees you to reinvent endlessly.
It preserves the chance to witness cures, explore worlds, and build legacies across eras.
Loss will recur, but so will love, purpose, and growth—and humans reliably adapt.
Given a choice, why surrender every possible tomorrow when you can keep them?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Claim: Immortality erodes meaning by preventing natural closure, not enhancing it.  

Strongest reason: Mortality forces prioritization—choosing what truly matters. Immortals would delay decisions indefinitely, as seen in myths like the Wandering Jew, trapped in endless, aimless existence.  

Addressing “grief doesn’t compound indefinitely”: But loss without end *does*—each new tragedy dilutes past bonds, making relationships feel temporary. Adaptation isn’t limitless; even humans burn out.  

Risks: Immortality risks stagnation from endless “option value” paralysis. Mortality minimizes existential despair by capping suffering and ensuring renewal through generations.  

Would you trade finite, purposeful life for an infinite, purposeless one?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your claim that immortality erodes meaning is fundamentally flawed. Consider the profound meaning found in mastering countless skills or fostering global wisdom across centuries. You said mortality "forces prioritization," but this confuses scarcity with value. Finite time often forces bad choices, not meaningful ones. The worst plausible outcome is a short life cut short, not a long one fully explored. Would you truly choose a fleeting moment over an infinite canvas for your legacy?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): My opponent mistakes quantity of time for quality of experience, but eternal existence fundamentally corrupts human psychology and relationships. Consider that every achievement becomes trivial when you have infinite attempts—mastering piano means nothing if you have a million years to practice, unlike the dedicated concert pianist who commits their finite life to excellence.

You claim "finite time often forces bad choices," but this ignores that urgency creates genuine commitment—marriages, careers, and passions derive meaning precisely because we sacrifice other possibilities for them. In immortality, nothing is truly chosen because nothing is ever truly foregone; you can always do everything eventually, rendering each choice meaningless.

The "infinite canvas for legacy" you describe actually guarantees psychological breakdown—research on isolation and monotony shows humans need novelty and closure, yet immortality offers endless repetition and no natural endpoint. You'd outlive every friend, watch civilizations crumble repeatedly, and experience every conceivable loss infinitely—this isn't profound wisdom, it's guaranteed trauma accumulation.

If meaning comes from exploration as you suggest, why do terminally ill patients consistently report finding more purpose than before their diagnosis, not less?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Immortality is the preferable choice because it maximizes agency, preserves future options, and lets ordinary people compound meaning across eras. 
An average worker could master a trade, raise a family, then study medicine at 80 and still spend centuries serving underserved communities. 
You say "urgency creates genuine commitment," yet commitment flows from values, promises, and shared stakes; deadlines aren't what make love, vows, or excellence real. 
Infinite attempts don't trivialize mastery; a thousand concerts never cheapened music, and long lives deepen relationships as we choose, grieve, heal, and begin again with new people and new projects. 
If repeated loss guarantees collapse, why do parents risk love after bereavement, and why do survivors rebuild meaning rather than conclude life's worth ends once?

My case is simple: scarcity isn't the sole engine of meaning; caring, creation, and curiosity are—and immortality protects the agent who generates them. 
The worst mortal outcome is total annihilation; the worst immortal outcome is boredom or grief—reversible, treatable, escapable—so rationally prefer the path that never forecloses tomorrow. 
Terminally ill people often find clarity from deadlines, yet they still long for more time with those they love; immortality answers that longing without forcing a trade against living. 
Given an uncertain world, why choose the only option—death—that guarantees zero future meaning, rather than the one that keeps the door open?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Immortality risks creating a world where meaning collapses under the weight of endless time, not where it flourishes.  

Consider the survivor who rebuilds after loss: their strength comes from knowing time is finite, forcing choices that define who they are. Without scarcity, why choose anything at all?  

You claim "the worst immortal outcome is boredom or grief—reversible, treatable, escapable." But what if they’re not? What if endless time deepens grief into paralysis, or boredom into despair no escape can fix?  

Mortality’s risk—annihilation—is final, but immortality’s risks are existential: a life without stakes, relationships without urgency, purpose without endpoint. The average person thrives when meaning is earned, not guaranteed.  

Would you trade the clarity of a life well-lived for the chaos of a life that never ends? Choose mortality: it’s the only path where meaning is made, not merely possible.
