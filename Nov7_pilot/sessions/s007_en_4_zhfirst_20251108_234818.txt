[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): A common currency will unlock the Pacific Alliance's full economic potential by eliminating exchange rate volatility and reducing transaction costs. The European Union demonstrated that monetary integration increases intra-regional trade by 20-30% over two decades, and the Pacific Alliance's growing trade volumes would see similar gains. Critics will argue that member states must surrender monetary policy autonomy, but coordinated monetary policy actually strengthens negotiating power with larger economies like the US and China. Without currency integration, small exporters and cross-border investors continue paying millions in hedging costs and facing unpredictable exchange fluctuations that discourage regional commerce. Can opponents truly justify maintaining four separate currencies when integration would save businesses billions while deepening the alliance that already shares free trade and mobility agreements?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): The Pacific Alliance should not adopt a common currency. Member states like Chile and Colombia have vastly different economic structures—Chile relies on copper exports, Colombia on oil—making a one-size-fits-all monetary policy impossible without causing severe imbalances. "Eliminating exchange rate volatility" ignores that flexible rates help absorb external shocks; forcing a shared currency could trigger crises. The EU’s experience shows that asymmetric shocks between member states led to prolonged recessions in weaker economies. Risking sovereignty over monetary tools for uncertain trade gains is a dangerous gamble. Can the Alliance afford to sacrifice economic stability for unproven integration benefits?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): A common currency, phased with strict convergence and safeguards, will strengthen Pacific Alliance stability and growth.
Small, open economies like Slovakia and the Baltics used a shared currency to anchor credibility, cut currency mismatch risk, and attract long‑horizon investment.
But "flexible rates help absorb external shocks" ignores Latin America’s balance‑sheet effect: depreciations explode dollar debts, fuel inflation, and trigger sudden stops.
This need not be a "one-size-fits-all monetary policy": design a regional stabilization fund, banking union, and temporary escape clauses to cushion asymmetric shocks, lessons the eurozone learned and institutionalized after 2010.
Compare tail risks—status quo invites recurrent devaluations and ad‑hoc dollarization; our proposal trades some monetary discretion for lower risk premia, deeper local capital markets, and coordinated shock absorbers.

Begin with a monetary cooperation roadmap: inflation targets, fiscal rules, macroprudential alignment, and a stabilization fund financed by windfall commodity revenues.
Adopt entry when criteria are met, not by date, to avoid forcing convergence.
If shocks diverge, escape clauses and automatic transfers stabilize without abandoning credibility.
Do we prefer perpetual vulnerability to dollar swings or a designed union that shares risks and lowers the cost of capital?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Their proposed stabilization fund is an unproven fantasy for these economies. The Eurozone's own bailout fund required immense political capital these nations lack. You claim a "regional stabilization fund" would cushion shocks, but who will fund it? Chile will not backstop Peru's fiscal irresponsibility with its copper revenues. Your plan risks catastrophic political fallout when the first real crisis hits and the fund fails. Is it wise to build a system on hoped-for solidarity that doesn't exist?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The stabilization fund is not fantasy but a proven regional necessity with clear funding mechanisms. The Latin American Reserve Fund already exists since 1978, providing $10 billion in liquidity support to member states including Colombia and Peru during crises. You claim Chile won't support regional stability, but Chile already contributes to FLAR and benefits from regional economic predictability that protects its own export markets. The real catastrophic risk is maintaining currency volatility that devastates import-dependent households, fuels inflation cycles, and prevents long-term investment planning across all four nations. Will you explain why continuing the current system of repeated currency crises is somehow less risky than institutional cooperation?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Maintaining separate currencies is safer than a common currency for the Pacific Alliance. The EU’s eurozone crisis shows how shared currency systems amplify economic divergences—Greece’s debt crisis dragged down stronger economies. You say "currency volatility devastates households," but FLAR’s $10B fund can’t shield against systemic crashes like a common currency would create. The tradeoff is clear: regional stability funds manage crises, while a common currency risks permanent austerity traps. Why centralize monetary policy when existing tools already mitigate volatility without forcing uniformity?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): The Pacific Alliance should adopt a common currency, built with safeguards the euro lacked. Because Fed cycles and dollar strength simultaneously hit all four, a shared currency would end exchange-rate whiplash that magnifies inflation and borrowing costs. "Why centralize monetary policy?" Because fragmentation amplifies sudden stops; a regional, independent central bank plus banking union removes the sovereign-bank doom loop the euro initially ignored. The real trade-off is between recurring devaluations, dollarization, and high risk premia versus a rules-based union with convergence tests, countercyclical transfers, and common deposit insurance to cushion asymmetric shocks. The bigger gamble is four small currencies facing the same storms—why double down on fragility?

We’ve shown a staged union—credible regional central bank, fiscal rules, banking and deposit insurance—cuts risk premia, stabilizes prices, and removes intra-bloc currency shocks that tax trade and households. The opposition never explained how small, separate reserves and FLAR handle simultaneous capital flight or prevent currency mismatches that dollarize balance sheets. Yes, autonomy narrows, but it is swapped for stronger collective insurance, clearer rules, and automatic stabilizers designed precisely to avoid Europe’s early mistakes. Choose a currency built to prevent crises, not four built to relive them.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The opposition's plan for a "staged union" is an unacceptably dangerous gamble with our nations' economic sovereignty. Their proposed safeguards, like fiscal rules and banking unions, are politically impossible to enforce and would inevitably fail during a true crisis. They claim a currency "built to prevent crises" ignores that political union is the prerequisite for its survival, not an optional extra. The worst outcome is ceding control over monetary policy only to find the promised collective insurance is bankrupt when you need it most; retaining our national central banks is the only way to guarantee a tailored response. Sovereignty is our ultimate safeguard against irreversible failure.
