[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Subscription models trap consumers in endless payments for products once bought outright, eroding ownership rights. Adobe’s shift from selling Photoshop to renting it at $21/month forces users to pay indefinitely for software they previously owned. Opponents argue subscriptions offer flexibility, but this ignores how companies exploit inertia to raise prices silently. The risk of being locked into recurring costs without recourse outweighs temporary convenience, as seen in Netflix’s repeated price hikes. Why surrender control over your wallet to corporations that profit from your dependency?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Subscriptions, chosen amid competition, expand access and upgrade quality by turning large upfront purchases into affordable, cancellable services. 
Xbox Game Pass and Spotify let users access vast libraries for a modest monthly fee, turning risky $70 games or $10 albums into low-commitment discovery. 
You warn about "endless payments"; yet subscriptions are cancellable, competitors are one click away, and alternatives like Affinity Photo or DaVinci Resolve offer buy-once options that discipline pricing. 
The worst risk here is lock-in and price creep; subscriptions minimize harm by letting people walk without sunk capital, unlike one-time buys that strand users on outdated, insecure versions. 
Why strip consumers of a pay-as-you-go option that spreads risk and maximizes choice?

Subscriptions lower barriers for students, startups, and casual users, while power users can still choose perpetual tools like Affinity and DaVinci Resolve. 
Market churn, clear cancellation flows, and competing bundles curb abuse better than blanket opposition. 
The smart policy is to demand transparency and portability, not to reject a model that funds continuous improvement. 
Keep subscriptions as a choice alongside ownership to serve diverse needs.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The subscription shift systematically transfers wealth from consumers to corporations while eroding ownership rights that protect long-term autonomy. Opposition's "cancellable" defense ignores that Adobe Creative Cloud users now pay $600 annually for software they previously owned outright for $1,000 once, meaning after two years they've paid more yet own nothing. When they claim subscriptions are "one click away" from cancellation, they obscure how companies like Adobe eliminated perpetual licenses entirely, forcing professionals into endless payments or abandoning years of proprietary file formats. The real trap isn't individual subscriptions but the coordinated industry abandonment of ownership options, leaving consumers no leverage when prices inevitably rise after market capture. If subscriptions truly serve consumer choice, why do dominant players systematically eliminate purchase alternatives once they achieve market power?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The subscription model democratizes access to cutting-edge tools for millions. Adobe's shift means a designer no longer needs a massive upfront investment, gaining continuous updates and cloud services. They claim "eroding ownership rights," but this ignores modern software's reality. Perpetual licenses were stagnant, leaving users with outdated, insecure software. Ownership's burden of obsolescence is far riskier than a cancellable subscription's flexibility. Does clinging to the illusion of ownership truly serve the user when technology constantly evolves?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Subscriptions don't democratize access—they trap users in recurring fees. Adobe's model forces designers into endless payments; if they cancel, they lose access to tools they once "owned." You claim "ownership's burden of obsolescence is riskier," but subscriptions shift that risk to users who may face sudden price hikes or service cuts. Perpetual licenses let users choose when to upgrade; subscriptions eliminate that control. Would you rather pay once and decide your timeline, or risk being held hostage by a company's pricing whims?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Subscriptions lower barriers, expand access, and align incentives for continuous support better than one‑off licenses.
Freelancers and students can start for a modest monthly fee instead of a prohibitive lump sum—think Microsoft 365 or Xbox Game Pass bundling updates and libraries.
You warn subscriptions "hold users hostage," yet perpetual buyers face dead software after OS changes, broken file support, and no security patches; WannaCry exploited unpatched, end‑of‑life Windows.
Price hikes are real, but subscriptions mitigate worse harms—obsolescence, vulnerabilities, and hardware/OS churn—while competition, annual plans, and data‑export features constrain switching costs.
When stakes are your security and continuity, is a cancelable, always‑updated service really riskier than betting your livelihood on frozen software?

Perpetual licenses push failure risk onto users: compatibility breaks, patches end, and files strand.
Subscriptions spread cost, fund maintenance, and let customers exit when value drops.
Bad actors or cases like Adobe deserve regulation and open‑format safeguards, not abolition of the model.
The worst loss is inaccessible work; subscriptions reduce that risk—so why choose the path likelier to leave you unsupported?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Throughout this debate, we have shown that subscription models systematically transfer power and wealth from users to corporations while eroding ownership and increasing long-term costs. Opposition claims subscriptions provide updates and security, yet perpetual software can receive patches through paid upgrade cycles without forcing indefinite payments—companies simply choose not to offer this because subscriptions maximize their revenue extraction.

When you say subscriptions let "customers exit when value drops," you ignore that exit means losing access to your own work, tools you've mastered, and workflows you've built—a hostage situation, not a fair marketplace. The real risk isn't obsolete software that you own and can continue using; it's paying forever for permission to access what should rightfully be yours, with companies raising prices and degrading terms once you're locked in.

We're not opposing all subscriptions—we oppose the increased shift that eliminates choice, making one-time purchases unavailable even when consumers prefer them. Give users both options, let competition and genuine preference decide, and watch how many choose ownership over rental when the choice isn't artificially restricted.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our opponents fundamentally mischaracterize the modern value exchange. Subscriptions guarantee continuous innovation and security, preventing the vulnerabilities of abandoned, outdated software. They claim this creates a "hostage situation," ignoring that perpetual licenses often become useless without costly upgrades. The worst outcome is technological stagnation, which our model actively prevents by aligning developer survival with user success. The future is access and service, not a one-time sale to a dead-end product.
