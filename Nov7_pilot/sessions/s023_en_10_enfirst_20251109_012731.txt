[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): India should prioritise policies to significantly reduce inequality over chasing rapid headline growth, because unequal growth is brittle, destabilising, and wastes human potential.
The post-pandemic K-shaped recovery saw formal sectors soar while informal workers struggled; boosting incomes, health, and education for the majority would expand demand and productivity, sustaining growth.
Opposition says "growth first, then redistribution"; yet decades show trickle-down rarely reaches informal India, and delayed redistribution hardens caste, gender, and regional gaps that markets alone don't close.
Even if inequality-first slightly tempers short-term GDP, it averts the worst risks—social unrest, political capture, and demand collapse—while building human capital, good jobs, and resilient consumption that underpin long-run growth.
The real test is not speed, but how many people move forward—will we measure success by a stock index, or by secure, dignified livelihoods?

Prioritising inequality reduction anchors demand, stability, and human capability, the foundations of durable prosperity.
India can do this through universal basic services, targeted social protection, fair taxation, and formalisation that creates productive jobs.
The alternative—chasing raw growth while disparities widen—invites volatility, disenchantment, and wasted talent.
Choose an economy that grows because people are included, not despite their exclusion.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): India must prioritize rapid economic growth because only a larger economic pie creates the resources necessary to meaningfully address poverty and inequality at scale. China's growth-first approach lifted 800 million from poverty in four decades, while India's earlier socialist policies produced stagnation and persistent deprivation despite equalizing intentions. The opposition claims trickle-down rarely reaches informal India, but India's growth acceleration post-1991 coincided with poverty rates falling from 45% to under 20%, proving expansion directly improves lives. Premature redistribution of a small economy means fighting over crumbs, condemning generations to shared poverty rather than building the tax base, infrastructure, and private sector jobs that fund schools, hospitals, and safety nets. If equity-focused policies could generate prosperity alone, why did India's pre-liberalization era of license raj and redistribution produce the Hindu rate of growth while hundreds of millions remained destitute?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The previous speaker claims "growth acceleration directly improves lives." Yet extreme inequality prevents this. India's billionaire wealth surged 1210% since 1990 while median incomes stagnate. This proves growth alone is not trickling down. Prioritizing inequality prevents social unrest and builds a stable consumer base for sustainable growth. Do you believe an economy can truly prosper when the majority cannot afford its goods?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): India cannot prioritize reducing inequality over growth without stunting progress. China lifted 800 million out of poverty since 1990 by prioritizing growth, creating markets that later supported wealth redistribution. "Growth alone is not trickling down" ignores that India's poverty rate fell from 60% to 10% since 1990 via growth-led policies. Slowing growth to redistribute wealth risks higher unemployment and fiscal instability, worsening inequality. Can a stagnant economy ever afford to redistribute?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Reducing inequality is the most reliable way to sustain India's growth.
IMF research shows high inequality shortens growth spells, while well-designed redistribution is generally growth-neutral or positive.
"China lifted 800 million out of poverty" because it paired markets with land reform, mass basic education, and rural health—equality-enhancing foundations—not laissez-faire trickle-down.
A growth-first path risks jobless expansion, weak demand, and instability; an equity-first path may temper headline GDP but builds human capital, productivity, and resilient consumption that compound.
If growth isn’t translating into secure jobs and rising wages, why double down on the same playbook?

We’re not choosing redistribution over growth; we’re choosing the kind of growth that lasts.
Targeted inequality-reducing investments—quality schooling, primary healthcare, urban services, and worker protections—raise productivity and crowd in private investment.
India’s own MGNREGA and mid-day meals stabilized demand and improved human capital when shocks hit.
If inequality is already choking demand and opportunity, how can you afford not to prioritize reducing it?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): You conflate growth-enhancing reforms with inequality reduction, but the sequencing matters critically. China's takeoff began with Deng's 1978 market liberalization and Special Economic Zones that unleashed rapid growth first; land reform and basic services came during Mao's era and were insufficient to end mass poverty without subsequent growth acceleration. Your claim that "well-designed redistribution is generally growth-neutral" ignores India's fiscal reality: we already spend 13% of GDP on subsidies yet face crumbling infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks that choke private investment daily. Prioritizing redistribution now means diverting capital from ports, power grids, and digital infrastructure that create the productive jobs you correctly note are missing—inequality falls naturally when labor demand outstrips supply. If equity-first policies reliably sustain growth, why did India's socialist License Raj era deliver both stagnation and persistent poverty while post-1991 liberalization halved poverty rates despite rising inequality?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our case rests on preventing irreversible social fracture from extreme inequality. Unchecked growth has created islands of prosperity in a sea of desperation, which is not a sustainable foundation. You claim "inequality falls naturally," but this ignores how wealth concentration stifles mass consumption and chokes the very demand that fuels growth. The trade-off is between lopsided growth that risks our social fabric and inclusive development that secures long-term stability for all. India's future prosperity depends on healing its divisions today.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): India’s priority must remain rapid economic growth, not enforced equality. China’s growth-first model lifted 800 million out of poverty; India’s per capita income quadrupled since 1991 by prioritizing growth. "Wealth concentration stifles mass consumption" ignores how growth creates jobs, raises wages, and expands the middle class organically. Forcing equality risks stagnation—slow growth entrenches poverty, while rapid growth generates resources to fund social programs later. Should India sacrifice progress for a theoretical ideal, or build wealth first to uplift all?
