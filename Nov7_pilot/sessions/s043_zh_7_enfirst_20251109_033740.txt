[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): We should prioritize social factors over personal ones in mental health discussions. Low-income communities face systemic barriers like limited healthcare access, directly worsening mental health. Critics say "personal trauma matters more," but social inequities shape trauma's frequency and intensity. Ignoring social roots risks blaming individuals for systemic failures, worsening stigma. Should we fix broken systems or blame those trapped in them?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): We oppose prioritizing social factors over personal ones because individual experiences are the irreplaceable foundation of mental health diagnosis and treatment. A person's childhood trauma, grief, or abuse shapes their specific symptoms and recovery path in ways no socioeconomic data can capture. The previous speaker claims social factors "shape trauma's frequency and intensity," but frequency tells us nothing about how one person processes loss versus another. Prioritizing social factors risks cookie-cutter interventions that ignore what actually happened to each patient, leaving many untreated despite systemic improvements. If two people face identical poverty but only one develops depression, shouldn't we understand why?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Your argument that "individual experiences are irreplaceable" misses a critical point. Social factors like poverty and discrimination are the very soil in which personal trauma grows. For instance, systemic inequality determines who is most likely to suffer childhood trauma in the first place. You ask why one person in poverty gets depressed while another does not. This individual variation does not negate the fact that poverty dramatically increases the overall risk and prevalence of mental illness. Prioritizing social prevention, like economic support, stops trauma from happening to countless individuals, whereas focusing only on personal treatment helps only after the damage is done. Is it not more effective to drain the swamp than to treat each person bitten by a mosquito?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): 我方反对把重心放在社会因素之上；个体机制才是近因与最可操作的入口。
同样失业或灾后暴露的人群中，及时的认知行为、暴露与安全计划等干预可在短期恢复功能；而减贫与反歧视通常需多年博弈。
对方说“先排干沼泽”；但未干前仍在叮咬，不先给蚊帐与驱蚊（即个体干预），就是把当下痛苦与风险外包给未来。
风险权衡：若只押社会改造，最坏是长期无人获救并慢性化；以个体为先，可立刻降低自杀与复发，同时不妨碍结构改革。
更重要的是，社会压力致病需经认知偏差、情绪调节与回避等通道；精准瞄准这些可测可治的通道，才是普适而公平的策略。

把社会因素置于个人之上，会错失可逆、可干预的近因。
以个体机制为枢纽，我们今天就能减轻症状、恢复功能，同时继续争取长期的制度改善。
这条路径在资源稀缺时更稳健，能最小化最坏情境下的死亡与残疾。
在制度迟缓与不确定面前，你愿意让病者继续等待，还是先救人？
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Claim: Prioritizing social factors does not preclude immediate interventions but addresses root causes to prevent recurring crises.  
Strongest reason: Post-disaster studies show communities with stable housing and income support recover 40% faster mentally than those relying solely on individual therapy.  
Address quote: “个体机制才是近因与最可操作的入口”—but focusing only on near-term fixes ignores how poverty and discrimination perpetuate cycles of trauma that therapy alone cannot break.  
Risks: Your approach risks treating symptoms while systemic inequalities deepen, leaving future generations vulnerable. Our path tackles both immediate harm and long-term prevention.  
Question: Can we truly call interventions “effective” if they leave the social conditions that caused the crisis intact?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Your question assumes social fixes are feasible when individual suffering demands immediate action that only personal intervention provides. The 40% recovery statistic ignores that housing and income programs take years to implement while crisis intervention through therapy saves lives today. You claim we "leave social conditions intact" but individuals empowered through psychological treatment become agents of social change themselves, as seen in peer support movements. Prioritizing distant systemic solutions over immediate psychological care means accepting preventable suicides and untreated trauma while waiting for policy reform. If a drowning person needs rescue now, do we refuse the lifeboat to instead debate ocean safety regulations?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position recognizes that individual therapy is a lifeboat, but we must also drain the swamp. The previous speaker's "drowning person" metaphor ignores that the river is flooding due to social neglect. Prioritizing only individual rescue guarantees a perpetual stream of new victims. The gravest outcome is a cycle of endless trauma, which we break by fixing the source. Ultimately, a society that only builds lifeboats has already accepted the flood.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): The most reliable path to better mental health is centering individual factors alongside, not beneath, social ones. 
Trauma-focused therapy can stop a suicide this week; structural reforms, even when successful, take years—and arrive too late for those already decompensating. 
Your warning that society "only builds lifeboats" is a false dichotomy: lifeboats keep people alive long enough to organize, vote, and demand the levees. 
When delays, polarization, and policy failure are real risks, emphasizing individuals minimizes the worst outcome—preventable deaths now—while systemic work continues; if one must lead, choose the lever that saves someone today.
