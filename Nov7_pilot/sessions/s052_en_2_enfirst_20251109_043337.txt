[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): US involvement in Panama has directly and measurably benefited the nation by stabilizing its democracy and economy. The 1989 intervention ended Manuel Noriega’s dictatorship, paving the way for democratic elections and institutional reforms. Critics claim "US intervention breeds dependency," but Panama’s post-Noriega GDP growth and sovereign control over the Canal Zone disprove this. Risks of instability from foreign intervention were outweighed by ending Noriega’s drug-trafficking regime and human rights abuses. Would Panama’s democracy and economy have thrived without US action?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): US intervention inflicted immense harm and violated Panama's sovereignty. The 1989 invasion caused thousands of civilian casualties and widespread destruction. They claim it "ended Noriega’s dictatorship," but it replaced one problem with trauma and dependency. This military action set a precedent for external control, risking national self-determination. Is a democracy truly built on the graves of its own people?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Panama today stands as Central America's most prosperous democracy, with the highest GDP per capita in the region and robust democratic institutions that have peacefully transferred power for decades. The 1989 intervention, while regrettably violent, removed a narco-dictator whose regime was itself killing and torturing Panamanians, creating the foundation for genuine self-governance. My opponent claims democracy was "built on graves," but ignores that Noriega's death squads were already filling those graves while the international community stood paralyzed. The real tradeoff was between temporary intervention and permanent tyranny—Panama's thriving economy, free press, and electoral system prove intervention enabled rather than prevented self-determination. Would Panamanians today trade their freedom and prosperity to return to Noriega's brutal dictatorship?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): US involvement in Panama, taken as a whole, harmed Panamanian sovereignty and lives.
Washington sustained Noriega for years—CIA ties, funding, and training—then toppled him in an invasion the UN General Assembly condemned as unlawful.
They call it "temporary intervention," but decades of U.S. leverage, Canal Zone legacies, and base presence belie "temporary" and helped create the crisis.
The real choice wasn't bombs or despotism; coordinated regional pressure, extradition for drug crimes, and support to Panama’s opposition offered a path with fewer civilian deaths and less corrosive precedent.
Swearing in Guillermo Endara on a U.S. base wasn't self-determination; Panamanians built democracy afterward despite, not because of, invasion.

Intervention removed Noriega but at the cost of civilian casualties, legal violations, and a precedent of U.S. veto over Panamanian destiny.
Beneficial involvement wouldn't first incubate a dictator, then claim credit for ousting him.
Panama’s democracy was built by Panamanians, canal autonomy movements, and institutions fostered before 1989, not by gunfire.
If sovereignty is only honored after invasion, whose freedom is it really?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): US involvement ultimately secured Panama’s sovereignty by dismantling Noriega’s regime, which had become a regional drug-trafficking hub threatening democratic stability.  

The 1989 invasion directly enabled Panama’s first democratic transition in decades, ending Noriega’s repression—including the torture and murder of opposition leaders—and paving the way for Endara’s government.  

You claim “Panama’s democracy was built by Panamanians… not by gunfire,” but Noriega’s own gunfire—suppressing elections, jailing dissidents—made peaceful transition impossible.  

The risks of inaction—a drug-fueled dictatorship destabilizing Central America—far outweighed the invasion’s civilian toll, which was limited compared to regional conflicts U.S. intervention prevented.  

Would you argue that tolerating Noriega’s crimes was a lesser violation of sovereignty than removing him?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): You ignore that US actions created Noriega, who was a long-time CIA asset. Your "limited civilian toll" dismisses thousands of Panamanian deaths as collateral damage. Sovereignty is not a gift an invader bestows after overthrowing a dictator they helped install. The worst outcome is normalizing military invasion as a legitimate tool for regime change, which sets a dangerous global precedent. Is overthrowing a monster you created really a moral victory or just cleaning up your own mess?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): US involvement in Panama, despite its flaws, ultimately delivered democratic governance and economic prosperity that Panamanians enjoy today. The opposition correctly notes America's past complicity with Noriega, but this actually strengthens our case—the US corrected its mistake rather than perpetuating dictatorship indefinitely. They claim we "dismiss thousands of Panamanian deaths," yet independent estimates place civilian casualties at hundreds, not thousands, while Noriega's regime brutalized citizens for years without accountability. The worst outcome isn't intervention against brutal dictators—it's abandoning populations to endless tyranny because rectifying past errors seems hypocritical. Panama thrives today precisely because imperfect justice proved better than perfect inaction.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): US involvement in Panama has consistently traded Panama’s sovereignty and lives for Washington’s interests, not Panama’s benefit.
The 1989 invasion, condemned by the UN General Assembly as violating international law, destroyed El Chorrillo and displaced thousands.
Even if we accept "hundreds, not thousands," the United States still refuses full transparency; Panamanian exhumations continue, and the Inter-American Commission has urged reparations for victims.
The worst plausible outcome is normalized, unilateral impunity: the arsonist claims hero status for dousing a fire it lit; our side favors lawful, multilateral pressure and institution-building that remove dictators without eroding sovereignty or civilian protections.
Justice that breaks the law to fix self-made disasters is not justice.

Panama’s prosperity stems from regained sovereignty, democratic mobilization, and the Canal handover—not from tutelage, coups, and an unlawful invasion.
Proponents never answered how decades of US-backed militarism and sanctions that strangled civilians were prerequisites to democracy.
We acknowledge removing Noriega mattered, but legitimizing unilateral invasions invites future abuses and keeps small nations expendable.
Choose sovereignty and the rule of law over paternalism; benefits that depend on violating both are not benefits.
