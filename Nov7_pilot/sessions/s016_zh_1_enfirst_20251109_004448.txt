[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The proposition to allow democratic legislatures a simple majority override of court rulings strengthens accountability and adaptability. In the US, the 1937 Court-packing crisis showed how rigid judicial supremacy can stall progress; a legislative override would provide a democratic check without needing radical reforms. Opponents may claim "this undermines judicial independence," but courts already rely on legislative compliance to enforce rulings. Risks of overreach are minimized by requiring a democratic majority, ensuring changes reflect public will rather than judicial ideology. Can we afford a system where unelected judges hold final say over laws affecting millions?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): The proposition fundamentally misunderstands that constitutional courts exist precisely to protect rights from temporary majorities, not to serve them. History proves this vital: in 1950s America, Brown v. Board of Education faced massive legislative opposition, yet the Court's independence allowed it to end school segregation despite popular resistance in many states. 

The opponent claims "courts already rely on legislative compliance," but this confuses enforcement cooperation with decision-making authority—judges must remain insulated from political pressure when interpreting fundamental rights. Allowing simple majority overrides creates catastrophic risk: a 51% legislature could systematically strip minority protections, religious freedoms, or due process rights whenever politically convenient, with no meaningful constitutional anchor. 

If legislative majorities always knew better than courts, why did so many democracies adopt judicial review after witnessing majoritarian tyranny's horrors in the 20th century?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition's historical example actually proves our point. Brown v. Board was ultimately enforced by congressional majorities through the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Their claim that courts exist "to protect rights from temporary majorities" ignores that unchecked judicial power itself creates an unelected oligarchy. A legislative check ensures the people's representatives can correct judicial overreach on fundamental societal questions. This system balances judicial insight with democratic accountability, preventing either branch from having absolute power. Shouldn't the final word on our most basic rights reside with the electorate, not nine unaccountable justices?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): A simple-majority override invites rapid, partisan erasure of fundamental rights.
Quebec’s use of the notwithstanding clause enabled Bill 21, banning religious symbols for teachers and police, overriding Charter protections and targeting Muslims, Sikhs, and Jews.
You claim "final word with the electorate"; in 1954, a Southern majority could have nullified Brown before Congress acted, entrenching segregation.
Judicial review already faces democratic checks—appointments, amendments, and tailored statutes—while our model averts the worst risk: whiplash majorities gutting minority protections and legal certainty.
Preserving a firm judicial backstop is the safer, democratically legitimate equilibrium.

If overrides are permitted at all, they must require supermajorities, delays, and rights carve-outs—not a one-vote swing.
History shows legislatures often target dissidents: Barnette protected Jehovah’s Witnesses; Texas v. Johnson protected flag-burners—rulings a simple majority could have erased.
Our side preserves stability and pluralism while retaining democratic pathways to change through elections, appointments, and constitutional amendment.
Don’t trade an imagined judicial ‘oligarchy’ for a real, revolving tyranny of the majority.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Simple-majority overrides don’t inherently erase rights—they demand accountability to voters. Quebec’s notwithstanding clause isn’t a model; it’s a loophole that bypasses debate. “Preserving judicial backstop” ignores that courts sometimes lag behind public will, like in Brown v. Board, where delay entrenched harm. Risks of “whiplash majorities” are overstated; voters punish extremes, making reckless overrides politically costly. Would you rather live under courts that sometimes fail democracy or legislatures that always answer to it?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): The false choice between courts and legislatures ignores that both must coexist with defined limits. Your Brown v. Board example actually proves our point—the Court led where majorities resisted, protecting children against entrenched racist majorities for decades. You claim "voters punish extremes," but history shows majorities routinely enacted Jim Crow, internment camps, and persecution of minorities when courts failed to intervene. Simple-majority overrides don't create accountability; they create tyranny with a democratic veneer, allowing 50.1% to strip rights from 49.9% without requiring supermajority consensus. If legislatures "always answer" to voters, why did it take judicial intervention to end school segregation, legalize interracial marriage, and protect voting rights against hostile majorities?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our system corrects judicial overreach while preserving fundamental rights. Legislatures better reflect evolving social values than unelected judges. They claim "courts protect against hostile majorities," yet judicial supremacy itself creates an unaccountable minority. The greater risk is a stagnant system where judicial error becomes permanent; our model allows for democratic correction. Ultimately, a functioning democracy trusts its people's representatives, not a judicial veto.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): We oppose a simple-majority override because it converts constitutional rights into mere preferences of the day.
In Canada, Quebec’s Bill 21 preemptively invoked an override to shield discrimination against religious minorities from Charter review for five years.
Your "trusts its people's representatives" claim ignores that guardrails exist because majorities can target minorities; judicial errors are slower and correctable via amendment or legislative redrafting, while your model enables immediate, partisan rights suppression by 50%+1, destabilizing constitutional commitments with each electoral swing.
When the next majority comes for your rights, who stops them?
