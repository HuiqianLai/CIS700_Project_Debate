[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Artistic value is fundamentally subjective, shaped by individual perception and cultural context. A painting deemed masterful by one may be meaningless to another; Van Gogh's "Starry Night" evokes awe in some, indifference in others. Critics argue "objective standards" like technique exist, but even technical mastery fails to guarantee value—Picasso's cubism broke rules yet is celebrated. Subjectivity allows diverse interpretations, fostering creativity, while enforced objectivity risks stifling innovation. Can we truly measure beauty with a ruler?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Artistic value is primarily objective because consistent cross-cultural appreciation and expert consensus reveal universal standards beyond personal taste. The mathematical precision in Bach's fugues, the anatomical mastery in Michelangelo's David, and the technical innovation in Hokusai's wave prints command recognition across vastly different societies and centuries. While the previous speaker claims "technical mastery fails to guarantee value," this conflates innovation with abandonment of standards—Picasso mastered classical techniques before deliberately subverting them, proving he understood objective principles first. If value were purely subjective, art education and criticism would be meaningless exercises, leaving society unable to distinguish genuine mastery from random scribbles, ultimately devaluing all artistic achievement. Does your framework provide any basis for separating skilled artists from frauds?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The previous speaker champions "expert consensus" as objective proof, yet experts themselves fiercely debate what constitutes great art. Consider Van Gogh, whose work was despised by the academic consensus of his time but is now celebrated. This historical shift reveals that consensus is not a fixed standard but a fluctuating social agreement. Your framework risks enshrining the biases of a powerful few as universal truth, silencing revolutionary voices. If value is objective, why does the canon of "great art" change so dramatically across generations?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Art’s value is discoverable through publicly assessable standards, not merely private taste.
Constraints like counterpoint, tonal harmony, perspective, and anatomical draftsmanship permit verification: Bach’s fugues reveal voice-leading integrity; Michelangelo’s Pietà displays stone-transcending finish and plausible anatomy—features describable, teachable, and independently checked.
You say "consensus is not a fixed standard"; changing consensus evidences observer error, not value’s inexistence—Van Gogh’s chromatic structure, composition, and facture were later recognized as achievements as color theory, perception research, and art-historical context improved.
A subjectivist stance empowers fads, algorithms, and propaganda to claim equal worth; an objective-leaning approach risks gatekeeping, yet mitigates it via transparent criteria, cross-cultural triangulation, and time’s error-correction, thus minimizing the worst outcome: the collapse of criticism into preference.
Objective standards do not silence revolutionaries; they justify them by showing which departures solve problems better than prior art.

Shifting judgments track learning curves, not the death of truth.
Craft, structure, and durable response affordances supply objective anchors.
These anchors enable teaching, critique, and conservation while resisting manipulation.
Choose objectivity-leaning evaluation to preserve standards, correct errors, and keep value from collapsing into taste.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Claim: Consensus on art’s value is inherently unstable, proving subjectivity’s primacy.  

Van Gogh’s work sold for pennies in his lifetime; now it’s priceless. Did the art change, or did collective taste evolve?  

You say “craft, structure… afford objective anchors,” but Van Gogh’s brushwork defied his era’s technical norms—his value emerged only when subjectivity shifted.  

Gatekeeping via “transparent criteria” risks excluding non-Western or avant-garde art; subjectivity allows diverse voices to challenge dominant standards without demanding universal approval.  

If objectivity truly “minimizes collapse into taste,” why did abstract expressionism’s rise require rejecting academic realism’s “objective” rules?  

Isn’t the real risk clinging to outdated standards that silence innovation?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Van Gogh's case proves objective value persists despite delayed recognition, not that value is primarily subjective. His innovative techniques—impasto layering, complementary color dynamics—embody measurable craft that experts now universally acknowledge as masterful, not merely fashionable. You claim his "brushwork defied technical norms," but defying convention through superior structural innovation differs fundamentally from arbitrary preference; rejecting rococo ornamentation for minimalism still requires evaluating compositional coherence objectively. If value were primarily subjective, we'd expect Van Gogh's reputation to fluctuate wildly across cultures today, yet his work commands consistent esteem globally because objective elements—emotional resonance through color theory, spatial depth—transcend individual taste. Does your framework explain why technically incompetent work remains obscure even when subjectivity "shifts," or does objective skill set a necessary floor for enduring value?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our opponents' "universal acknowledgment" merely proves widespread subjective consensus, not objective fact. Consider Duchamp's "Fountain," an industrially made urinal now enshrined in art history; its value is conferred entirely by context and shifting critical opinion, not inherent measurable properties. They claim Van Gogh's esteem is "consistent globally," yet his reception varies immensely across different cultural and historical contexts. A world prioritizing objective measures risks enshrining a rigid, exclusionary canon that stifles artistic innovation and dismisses new forms of expression. The worst outcome is an art world deaf to diverse voices, which our subjective framework prevents by celebrating pluralistic interpretation. Art's true endurance lies in its perpetual re-evaluation by each new generation.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Art's value is primarily anchored in objective features—craft, structure, innovation, and durable influence—that constrain judgment.
The Rembrandt Research Project's de-attributions changed museum labels and scholarship because brushwork analysis, materials, and chronology are testable facts, showing value tracks more than taste.
Your "merely proves widespread subjective consensus" misses independent convergence: from Chinese calligraphic balance to Bachian counterpoint, trained assessors find repeatable excellence shaped by human perception and medium.
Yes, rigid canons are a risk, but unchecked subjectivism breeds fads, gatekeeping-by-hype, and cultural nihilism; transparent, revisable objective standards best protect diversity while preserving meaning—judge art pluralistically, but against real, shared criteria.
