[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The internationalisation of intellectual property law centralizes power, stifles innovation, and entrenches global inequality. Developing nations face crippling barriers: India’s generic drug industry, which saved millions during HIV crises, was nearly destroyed by global IP patents. "Innovation thrives on open access," they claim—yet stricter laws block local adaptations, freezing progress where it’s needed most. The risks of monopolized knowledge outweigh theoretical gains; without regional flexibility, marginalized creators lose voice. Can we afford a world where life-saving ideas are locked behind corporate paywalls?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): International intellectual property harmonization creates the predictable framework necessary for global innovation to flourish and reach those who need it most. Consider that pharmaceutical companies invest over a decade and billions in drug development; without international patent protection, these investments collapse and research into rare diseases or emerging epidemics simply stops. The opposition claims stricter laws "block local adaptations," but India's generic industry thrives precisely because TRIPS includes flexibilities like compulsory licensing during health emergencies. The real risk is fragmented IP systems where inventors avoid markets with weak protection, leaving developing nations with neither innovation nor technology transfer. Should we return to a world where life-saving research never begins because companies cannot recoup costs across borders?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Internationalising IP law entrenches monopolies and delays access to health, seeds, and knowledge. During COVID‑19, a TRIPS waiver to share vaccine IP was stalled for over a year, constraining Global South manufacturing despite unused capacity in firms like Biolyse, Afrigen, and Teva. You say "TRIPS includes flexibilities"; in practice, Thailand’s 2007 AIDS drug compulsory licenses triggered U.S. trade threats, and TRIPS‑plus deals add data exclusivity and patent-term extensions that hobble generics. The worst risk of harmonization is globalized delay and unaffordable prices; the worst risk of tailored national regimes is uncertainty that can be mitigated with domestic patents, prizes, and public R&D—yet it preserves lifesaving competition and local adaptation. Fragmentation in IP rules can be a feature, not a bug, because it diversifies pathways for access, experimentation, and accountability.

Harmonization exports the strictest rules, empowers evergreening, and chills compulsory licensing, raising prices and slowing diffusion. Our model—plural national standards plus multilateral safeguards like the Doha Declaration—keeps incentives while letting countries act when markets fail. Even pharma thrived alongside generics where countries used Section 3(d) and voluntary licenses; innovation continued, access improved. If predictability means globally locked-in monopoly delay, why prefer it over a system that predictably delivers timely, affordable access?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): International IP law is essential for enabling the global cooperation that solved our greatest crises. It was the TRIPS-backed guarantee that facilitated the unprecedented sharing of vaccine technology, not its absence. They claim "harmonization exports the strictest rules," yet the Doha Declaration is a binding, multilateral safeguard ensuring flexibilities for public health. The worst outcome is not high prices but no innovation at all, which our system of global standards and safeguards prevents. Would the speaker prefer a fragmented world where no company risks billions to solve the next pandemic?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): Claim: International IP law's "harmonization" often entrenches corporate power over public health.  

Strongest reason: During the COVID crisis, Moderna refused to share vaccine patents despite TRIPS, forcing low-income nations to wait years for doses. Flexibilities like the Doha Declaration are toothless without enforcement.  

Addressing key point: "Doha Declaration is a binding safeguard." Yet Moderna’s refusal proved binding rules don’t guarantee access when profits clash with equity.  

Risks: Your system risks millions of lives when corporations prioritize monopolies over global solidarity. Fragmented IP laws might slow innovation, but centralized ones actively block life-saving access.  

Would you call a system "essential" when it lets companies hold humanity’s survival hostage to patent royalties?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): The Moderna example proves internationalization works, not that it fails. TRIPS flexibilities enabled India and South Africa to manufacture generic vaccines domestically, vaccinating billions without waiting for Moderna's permission—something impossible under fragmented national IP systems where cross-border production faces legal chaos.

Your claim that "binding rules don't guarantee access" ignores that 70% of COVID vaccines reached developing nations through COVAX and compulsory licensing mechanisms that exist only because of international IP frameworks. Without harmonized law, each country would negotiate separately with pharmaceutical companies, eliminating collective bargaining power entirely.

The real risk is your alternative: fragmented IP systems where innovators refuse to operate in unpredictable legal environments, concentrating all vaccine development in wealthy nations. International law created the Doha Declaration precisely to balance innovation incentives with health emergencies—imperfect implementation doesn't negate the framework's necessity.

If Moderna's behavior troubled you, why advocate destroying the only system that gives developing nations legal tools to override such patents? Your solution abandons the mechanism that enabled generic production while offering no alternative except hoping corporations voluntarily surrender profits.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Internationalising IP law entrenches corporate control, delays lifesaving access, and chills domestic innovation in crises.
During COVID, the TRIPS waiver stalled while the WHO mRNA hub in South Africa had to reverse‑engineer Moderna’s vaccine because no firm shared know‑how.
“TRIPS flexibilities enabled India and South Africa” ignores that Serum Institute relied on private licences, Aspen’s fill‑finish lines went idle for lack of orders, and compulsory licences were rare due to slow procedures and political pressure.
Harmonisation creates a single high wall—TRIPS‑plus obligations spread via trade deals and restrictive standards become hard to escape—whereas plural systems let regions use competition law, government‑use, oppositions, and pooled procurement to expand supply.
COVAX’s shortfalls came from bilateral hoarding and export bans; it reflected ad‑hoc charity, not rights guaranteed by international IP, proving dependence instead of durable, enforceable access.

At heart, this is about power: global IP harmonisation centralises vetoes in a few firms and capitals, exporting stricter rules and shrinking policy space where needs are greatest.
The opposition never showed how their framework compels timely tech transfer or prevents TRIPS‑plus leakage through trade deals and diplomatic pressure when emergencies hit.
We accept some fragmentation risk, but regional compacts, open‑licensing mandates for publicly funded R&D, and strong competition law create many workable paths—without locking the world to one rigid standard.
When the next emergency arrives, do you want a single global chokepoint—or multiple lawful routes to scale access?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): International IP law provides the essential framework for global cooperation and innovation sharing. It was voluntary licensing, not its absence, that enabled the production of billions of COVID-19 vaccine doses worldwide. Their claim of a "single global chokepoint" ignores the existing flexibilities within TRIPS that nations utilized. The greater risk lies in a fragmented system that stifles the cross-border collaboration needed to tackle crises. A predictable international system, not protectionist isolation, is our best defense against future pandemics.
