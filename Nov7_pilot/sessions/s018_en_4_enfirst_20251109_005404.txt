[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): This House should prefer IMF loans with only anti-corruption conditions to the current conditionality.
In 2020, the IMF’s rapid instruments, with minimal ex ante conditions, moved money fast and let governments protect health and incomes—proof that limited conditionality works when speed and policy space matter most.
The previous speaker says “conditionality ensures reforms”; yet Argentina and Ghana show externally imposed austerity without domestic ownership unravels, fuels backlash, and delays growth, whereas reform space plus accountability builds legitimacy and durability.
The worst risk under our model is waste; under theirs, it is pro‑cyclical cuts, unrest, and democratic erosion—anti‑corruption audits, transparency, and ex post reviews check misuse far better than blunt macro strings prevent the social and economic harm their programs routinely trigger.
Stop using loans as policy levers when what borrowers need is liquidity, stability, and trust.

A clean-conditions regime—anti-corruption only—delivers speed, policy ownership, and macro stability.
It averts the predictable damage of one‑size austerity while still protecting funds from theft.
Their model’s best case is coerced compliance; its worst case is crisis deepened and legitimacy burned.
Why should lifesaving finance come tied to policies voters never chose?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Blanket removal of IMF conditions risks macroeconomic instability and long-term debt crises, outweighing short-term speed gains. Sri Lanka’s 2020-2022 debt spiral, fueled by unconditional borrowing and weak fiscal frameworks, proves minimal oversight invites reckless spending. “Stop using loans as policy levers” ignores that targeted reforms prevent unsustainable debt—without them, countries face worse crises. The worst risk here isn’t austerity but systemic collapse; anti-corruption alone can’t stabilize currencies or balance budgets. Would you risk another Sri Lanka for unchecked policy space?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition fears instability, but their conditions create it. Argentina's 2018 record loan failed precisely because harsh austerity strangled growth, triggering a deeper crisis. They claim "minimal oversight invites reckless spending," yet their oversight often mandates recession. The worst outcome is a strangled recovery, not unchecked spending, which anti-corruption safeguards prevent. Why prioritize theoretical stability over proven, growth-oriented development?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The Argentina example actually proves our case, not theirs. That 2018 loan failed because Argentina had already spent years under governments that abandoned fiscal discipline, accumulating massive debt and inflation before seeking IMF help. The proposition claims "their oversight often mandates recession," but removing conditions means no accountability when governments print money recklessly or sustain unsustainable subsidies that guarantee future collapse. Even with anti-corruption provisions, nothing stops populist leaders from implementing economically disastrous policies that win votes today but bankrupt nations tomorrow. The worst outcome isn't slower short-term growth under reform, it's Venezuela-style hyperinflation when unchecked spending destroys entire economies, leaving decades of poverty.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Removing policy conditionality, while enforcing anti-corruption, produces more effective and legitimate stabilization than austerity-laden IMF programs. In 1997, IMF-forced bank closures in Indonesia sparked runs and recession; IMF’s ex-post review admits Argentina 2018’s conditionality was unrealistic and destabilizing. You claim “Argentina example actually proves our case”; yet the IMF’s own evaluation concludes design flaws and procyclical tightening amplified capital flight and collapse. Conditionality risks deep, legitimacy-eroding recessions that topple governments and reverse reforms; anti-corruption-only lending preserves countercyclical policy space while market discipline, program caps, and transparency checks deter reckless spending. If conditionality averts catastrophe, why did it magnify Indonesia 1997 and Argentina 2018?

Our model keeps money clean while letting democracies choose stabilizing, growth-preserving paths. That reduces the probability of panic, unrest, and policy reversals that doom programs. Their model bets on technocratic micromanagement that too often proves procyclical and politically unsustainable. Which is the safer bet: clean funds with domestic responsibility, or rigid austerity that has already failed loudly?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Claim: Removing all policy conditionality except anti-corruption risks destabilization and moral hazard, undermining the IMF’s core mandate.  

Strongest reason: Pakistan’s 2022 IMF program, which relaxed fiscal targets to avoid austerity, led to a 30% currency devaluation and 27% inflation, worsening poverty. Structural reforms, though painful, prevented collapse.  

“Anti-corruption-only lending preserves countercyclical policy space” ignores that without reforms, governments may prioritize short-term spending over long-term stability, risking default.  

Risk tradeoff: Conditionality’s political cost is outweighed by preventing uncontrolled debt crises. Anti-corruption alone cannot ensure fiscal discipline; 2010s Greece shows austerity was unavoidable post-default.  

If “clean funds with domestic responsibility” worked, why did Sri Lanka’s 2019 tax cuts, unchecked by conditionality, lead to default?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our model prioritizes national sovereignty over ineffective austerity. The opposition cites Pakistan's crisis, ignoring that IMF conditions themselves caused the social unrest which destabilized its economy. Their claim that "austerity was unavoidable" confuses symptom with cause; it was the lack of policy space that forced the default. The risk of painful, externally-imposed reforms far outweighs the benefit of allowing nations to craft their own recovery, preventing the human cost of collapse. True development requires trust in local institutions, not rigid conditionalities.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Our opponents romanticize sovereignty while ignoring that IMF conditions exist precisely because unchecked local institutions repeatedly failed their citizens through corruption and mismanagement. Their claim that "lack of policy space forced the default" inverts causality; Pakistan defaulted because decades of unconstrained borrowing without reform created unsustainable debt, not because reforms were too strict. Removing conditions except anti-corruption provisions sounds appealing until you realize corruption thrives through bad policy choices like fuel subsidies benefiting elites, currency manipulation enriching insiders, and bloated public sectors rewarding political loyalists. The worst outcome isn't temporary austerity pain but permanent poverty traps where borrowed billions disappear into Swiss accounts while children starve, which our structural conditions prevent and their model enables.
