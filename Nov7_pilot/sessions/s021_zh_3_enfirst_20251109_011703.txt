[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): 我们主张在高犯罪率地区实施铁腕治安，以迅速夺回街头与社区控制权。
萨尔瓦多对帮派的强力集群拘捕与高密度巡逻，打破了敲诈链条，让学校与市场重新开放，居民敢在夜间出行。
针对“这会导致人权侵害”，我们以司法审查、期限明确的紧急状态、随身摄像与独立检察监督将其可控，而放任帮派统治本身就是持续的人权剥夺。
权衡而言，温和渐进在极端暴力生态中常被帮派俘获；若将铁腕限定热点、设时限与申诉渠道，最坏情形可控，最佳情形是迅速止血并为社会政策赢得空间。
不先止暴，谈何教育、就业与复原？

铁腕治安并非永续统治，而是高犯罪区的应急止血术。
与法治保障、数据化指挥、社区监督配套时，它能迅速恢复国家对暴力的正当垄断。
相较拖延与失控，我们的方案把风险锁在时间与空间上，并对执法者设硬约束。
你愿让孩子继续走在被帮派统治的街上吗？
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Iron-fist policies in high-crime areas risk perpetuating violence rather than solving it. In Honduras, similar crackdowns led to over 10,000 arbitrary arrests, with 80% of detainees later released for lack of evidence—fueling resentment and cycles of retaliation. "司法审查、期限明确的紧急状态" cannot erase the reality that mass raids often target vulnerable communities, not just criminals. The trade-off is clear: short-term "control" via fear versus long-term trust-building through community policing and social investment. Would you rather have streets temporarily cleared by force or permanently safe through justice?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The previous speaker's "cycles of retaliation" theory ignores successful precedents. El Salvador's territorial control plan drastically cut homicide rates by targeting gang infrastructures. Their claim about "targeting vulnerable communities" misrepresents the objective. Our policy focuses on gang strongholds, not random communities, preventing state collapse from criminal takeover. A temporary, lawful surge is preferable to permanent criminal dominion over entire neighborhoods. Would you allow gangs to govern territories unchallenged?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): El Salvador's celebrated homicide reduction came at catastrophic human rights costs that undermine long-term stability. Over 70,000 people were imprisoned under Bukele's crackdown, with documented cases of arbitrary detention, torture, and deaths in custody according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The opposition claims to focus on "gang strongholds, not random communities," but mass detention policies inevitably sweep up innocent residents without due process guarantees. This approach trades immediate violence reduction for state-sanctioned abuse, creating grievances that fuel the next generation of criminality while destroying public trust in institutions. If we legitimize authoritarian methods, what prevents governments from expanding repression beyond gangs to silence dissent entirely?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): A rigorously safeguarded Mano Dura can halt predatory violence fast while preserving democratic checks. After focused crackdowns, El Salvador’s public transport, markets, and schools in former gang enclaves resumed normal activity, showing that disabling extortion networks quickly reduces killings and fear. You claim "mass detention policies inevitably sweep up innocent residents"; our model rejects dragnets via named warrants, evidentiary thresholds, on-site prosecutors, 48-hour judicial review, bodycams, and independent prison monitors. Authoritarian drift is prevented by sunset clauses, legislative renewal, transparent detainee registries, and court oversight; the worst alternative is continuing gang sovereignty with routine murders and displacement—our safeguards minimize abuse while ending the deadliest status quo. If not this, what credible plan stops extortion and killings within months without conceding neighborhoods to gangs?

Hard choices in high-crime zones demand immediate incapacitation of the most violent actors. We combine targeted raids with due process guardrails—sunsets, oversight, habeas triage, ombudsman access, and public reporting—to confine state power. This twin track reduces violence now and rebuilds trust through verifiable accountability. Choose the policy that saves lives fast without licensing tyranny: safeguarded Mano Dura.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Safeguarded Mano Dura still risks entrenching cycles of violence by normalizing state brutality. In Honduras, a similar model with judicial oversight led to a 300% rise in extrajudicial killings, as cops faced no consequences for overreach. You claim "targeted raids with due process guardrails" halt violence fast, but El Salvador’s own ombudsman reported 78% of detainees were low-level affiliates or innocent. The tradeoff isn’t between tyranny and gang rule—it’s between short-term "peace" via fear and long-term trust through community policing. Would you accept a 20% error rate in wrongful arrests if it meant saving lives now?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position remains that controlled Mano Dura is the only viable shield for communities under siege. El Salvador’s state of emergency rescued municipalities once wholly governed by gangs, restoring basic security. You cite "wrongful arrests" but ignore the alternative: total impunity. While imperfect, this policy prevents the far greater evil of societal collapse, making lasting reform possible. The urgent moral choice is to stop the bleeding before you can heal the wound.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The proposition asks us to embrace authoritarianism as medicine, but the cure proves deadlier than the disease. El Salvador's model has imprisoned over 75,000 people, many without trial, creating a police state where basic rights vanish and innocent citizens live in fear of arbitrary detention.

The claim that we must "stop the bleeding before healing" falsely assumes these are sequential steps when evidence shows iron-fist policies actively prevent sustainable solutions by destroying judicial institutions, radicalizing communities, and breeding the next generation of violence. Honduras and Guatemala both tried Mano Dura policies in the 2000s, only to see gang membership and homicide rates climb as brutalized youth joined criminal organizations and corrupted security forces became indistinguishable from the gangs themselves.

The worst outcome is not imperfect justice but permanent tyranny dressed as temporary emergency, where governments discover that surrendering power proves far harder than seizing it and societies lose both security and freedom. Choose evidence-based prevention over the authoritarian trap.
