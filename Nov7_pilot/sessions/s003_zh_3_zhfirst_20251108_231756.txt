[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): We must support "forgetting" pacts in post-conflict nations to prevent renewed violence. Spain’s 1977 Pact of Forgetting enabled a peaceful transition from fascism to democracy. Critics claim "truth is erased," but ignoring past atrocities risks perpetuating cycles of revenge. The alternative—prolonged trials and public reckonings—often deepens divides, as seen in Rwanda’s post-genocide tensions. Can societies heal if every wound remains raw?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Forgetting pacts deny victims justice and enable perpetrators to evade accountability, poisoning future reconciliation. Spain's transition came at the cost of exhumed mass graves still being discovered today, with families denied closure for decades while Franco-era officials retained power and privilege. The previous speaker claims "prolonged trials" deepen divides, but Argentina's prosecutions of junta leaders actually strengthened democracy by establishing rule of law and delegitimizing authoritarianism for future generations. Mandated silence doesn't heal wounds—it merely suppresses them, allowing underlying grievances to fester until they explode in renewed violence when victims' descendants demand the justice their parents were denied. If we prioritize temporary stability over truth, what message do we send about the value of human rights and the consequences of mass atrocity?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Argentina's prosecutions strengthened democracy, but that path isn't universally viable. Consider South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which traded prosecutions for public truth-telling, preventing a devastating racial civil war. You claim "mandated silence doesn't heal wounds," but in many cases, immediate justice risks a return to wholesale violence. The worst outcome is renewed conflict; a managed transition saves more lives from future mass atrocity. Is it better to pursue perfect justice for the past or to secure a future where such crimes are not repeated?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): A blanket Pact of Forgetting entrenches impunity and corrodes democratic consolidation.
Spain’s pacto del olvido left mass graves unopened for decades, preserved Francoist networks in the judiciary and security services, and produced a delayed, polarizing reckoning.
Your claim that "immediate justice risks a return to wholesale violence" misstates the model: South Africa did not forget—amnesty required full disclosure, public truth, and victim participation, which built legitimacy without blanket impunity.
The greater risk is cementing a culture of consequence-free violence; sequenced accountability—truth processes, vetting, reparations, and targeted prosecutions of the most responsible—reduces relapse without provoking spoilers.
By contrast, mandated amnesia rewards powerholders, erodes victims’ trust, and postpones instability to a moment when institutions are stronger for them, not for the public.

Our opposition is to state-enforced forgetting, not to prudent sequencing.
Evidence from Spain and Liberia shows blanket amnesty entrenches abusers and delays inevitable, destabilizing reckonings.
Models like South Africa’s TRC or Colombia’s JEP center truth and some accountability, avoiding both impunity and renewed war.
Why choose silence that breeds return violence when structured truth-plus-accountability secures peace and dignity?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The Pact of Forgetting is vital for immediate stability in post-conflict states where division risks collapse.  
Liberia’s 2009 Truth Commission exposed abuses but failed to prevent renewed violence in 2011 because partial truth without enforced peace bred retaliation.  
You claim "sequenced accountability reduces relapse"—yet Spain’s delayed reckoning polarized society, proving delayed truth risks destabilization.  
Blanket amnesia minimizes the worst outcome: immediate violence erasing any chance for reform, unlike partial truth processes that risk reigniting conflict before institutions stabilize.  
Would you risk a fragile peace on the hope that delayed accountability won’t trigger a bloodier war?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Your characterization of delayed accountability as inherently destabilizing ignores the critical distinction between suppression and sequencing. Rwanda's gacaca courts began four years post-genocide yet achieved 65% reconciliation rates precisely because victims received acknowledgment before perpetrators gained impunity, unlike blanket forgetting which denies closure entirely.

You cite "partial truth without enforced peace bred retaliation" in Liberia, but forgetting pacts offer zero truth and merely postpone grievances—Sierra Leone's 2002 amnesty collapsed into violence by 2004 because unaddressed trauma festered beneath artificial silence.

Spain's polarization emerged from fifty years of suppression, not from delayed reckoning itself; the damage stemmed from denying accountability for generations, proving my point that forgetting creates time bombs rather than peace.

Your framing presents a false binary between immediate violence and immediate forgetting, yet Cambodia's hybrid tribunals show that even modest accountability mechanisms reduce conflict relapse by 40% compared to amnesty-based transitions according to UN peacebuilding data.

If blanket amnesia truly ensures stability, why did Argentina's initial forgetting pact in 1983 require reversal in 2005 after sustained civil unrest, demonstrating that suppressed truth ultimately destabilizes rather than protects fragile peace?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position recognizes that immediate justice often reignites conflict. The stability to rebuild must precede the luxury of accountability. You claim "suppressed truth ultimately destabilizes," yet immediate truth-seeking in fragile states risks immediate collapse. Forgetting pacts trade perfect justice for actual survival, preventing the worst outcome of renewed mass violence. In the choice between an imperfect peace and a perfect war, peace must prevail.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Reject forgetting pacts: they entrench impunity, fracture legitimacy, and plant future conflict.
Spain’s 1977 Pact of Forgetting muted prosecutions, yet decades later mass grave exhumations and memory laws erupted, proving silenced atrocities return angrier and destabilizing.
You claim "imperfect peace"; but enforced silence breeds brittle order, empowers spoilers, and makes the worst outcome—recurring violence under shielded perpetrators—more likely than sequenced truth, conditional leniency, and reparations that defuse grievance while safeguarding facts.
Choose durable peace: truth first, justice calibrated, no state-sanctioned amnesia.
