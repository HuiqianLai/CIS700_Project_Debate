[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Post-revolutionary states must emphasize lower-class leadership to build legitimate, stable democracies rooted in popular sovereignty. When revolutions are portrayed as elite-led, citizens feel excluded from their own liberation, breeding cynicism and undermining the democratic culture necessary for lasting change. Elites already dominate economic and cultural institutions, so minimizing their revolutionary role prevents dangerous oligarchic capture of the state's founding narrative. The worst outcome is not imperfect history but entrenched inequality justified by myths of benevolent elite saviors who demand perpetual deference from grateful masses. Should we really let those who already hold power also monopolize the story of how freedom was won?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Elite leadership is indispensable for stable post-revolutionary governance. History shows that successful revolutions require the strategic direction only educated elites can provide. The previous speaker warns of "oligarchic capture of the state's founding narrative." This confuses post-revolution governance with its origins, which are distinct phases. Erasing elite contributions risks creating a power vacuum filled by demagogues, not democrats. Should we risk chaos by ignoring the architects of order?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Deemphasizing elites in revolutionary narratives does not erase their role but centers the people’s power, which is vital for legitimacy. The Cuban Revolution’s official history highlights rural fighters and urban workers over intellectuals, yet still acknowledges strategic guidance—proving both can coexist. "Erasing elite contributions risks chaos" ignores that marginalizing the masses breeds resentment, not order. By prioritizing popular agency, states avoid elite monopolies that often morph into new oligarchies, as seen in post-Soviet Russia. Would you rather risk demagoguery through exclusion or systemic inequality through elite dominance?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Deemphasizing elites in post-revolutionary narratives breeds bad governance and brittle legitimacy. 
Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge exalted peasants and demonized “new people,” turning narrative into purges, brain drain, and famine. 
You say "both can coexist"; in practice, propaganda crowds out nuance—Cuba’s canon venerates a vanguard while silencing independent workers’ histories. 
The real trade-off is populist purges versus elite capture; a truthful coalition narrative spreads prestige across organizers, cadres, professionals, and communities, preserving expertise while constraining oligarchs. 
Legitimacy rests on truth and capacity, not on a flattering monoclass myth. 

Balanced, accurate narratives anchor inclusive institutions and professional capacity. 
South Africa’s post-1994 story honored township resistance and Mandela’s elite negotiators, enabling reconciliation, not purges. 
Tunisia’s transition credited unions, lawyers, activists, and technocrats—the Nobel Quartet—sustaining compromise against polarizers. 
Tell the whole coalition story, and you tame both oligarchy and demagoguery.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The opponent's "truthful coalition narrative" still centers elite negotiators while ordinary people remain props in their own liberation story. Your South Africa example proves our point: despite millions mobilizing in townships, global memory fixates on Mandela and de Klerk's handshake, erasing the rank-and-file who made negotiations unavoidable through sustained resistance. The Khmer Rouge comparison is intellectually dishonest—we advocate elevating grassroots contributions in historical narratives, not exterminating educated classes or destroying state capacity. The real trade-off isn't truth versus propaganda; it's whether post-revolutionary states perpetuate colonial-era hierarchies where elites receive credit for movements they joined late, or whether they redistribute historical recognition to match actual sacrifice and risk. Does your "balanced narrative" explain why French schoolchildren learn Robespierre's name but not the sans-culottes who stormed the Bastille, and how does that silence serve inclusive institutions?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Your "erasing the rank-and-file" claim ignores that elite leadership prevented a racial civil war. Our coalition narrative honors all contributors without scapegoating necessary architects of stability. You equate balanced history with colonial hierarchy, a false dichotomy that fuels resentment. Demanding elites be deemphasized risks creating new historical silences, which is its own form of propaganda. Shouldn't a nation's foundational story highlight unity over class grievance to build a lasting peace?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Post-revolutionary states must center lower-class agency to dismantle elite-centric myths that sustain inequality. Cuba’s 1959 revolution succeeded because rural sugar workers and urban poor mobilized mass strikes, not just Castro’s leadership—yet official histories often reduce their role. You claim "balanced history fuels resentment," but erasing working-class struggle fuels apathy, not unity. Deemphasizing elites risks some silence, but perpetuating elite-led narratives entrenches class divides that undermine lasting peace. When we prioritize the people’s voice, we build a foundation for true equity—whose revolution is it, really?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Post‑revolutionary states should teach plural, balanced histories rather than downgrading any group.
When states recast revolutions as solely "of the people," anti‑elite purges often follow: the Khmer Rouge hunted teachers and doctors; the Cultural Revolution persecuted experts; both wrecked capacity and empowered demagogues.
You warn "balanced history fuels resentment," yet resentment explodes when narratives erase complexity—Mexico’s post‑1910 myth glorified campesinos while masking new party elites, breeding cynicism and authoritarianism under revolutionary branding.
Yes, centering popular agency corrects elite bias, but deemphasising elites also sidelines the very administrators, jurists, and financiers needed to stabilize currencies, build courts, and deliver services; a balanced narrative legitimizes their roles while still honoring organizers, strikers, and guerrillas.
Cuba’s mass mobilization mattered, but even there teachers, doctors, and administrators were indispensable to literacy and public health—roles any durable state must highlight because revolutions endure on competence as well as courage.
Our side defends a plural narrative that protects inclusion without erasure.
The proposition’s cure—systematically deemphasising elites—invites populist mythmaking, policy incompetence, and future witch hunts.
The worst plausible outcome on our path is lingering bias; theirs risks shattered institutions and retaliatory violence—we minimize harm by teaching many hands built the revolution.
Choose plural truth over purifying myth.
