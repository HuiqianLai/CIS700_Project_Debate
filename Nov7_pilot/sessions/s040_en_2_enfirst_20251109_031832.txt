[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Our moral duty demands we stop the slaughter in Sudan. We have seen this before in Rwanda, where global inaction permitted genocide. The opposition will claim "intervention violates sovereignty." But sovereignty cannot be a shield for mass murder. Failing to act guarantees a humanitarian catastrophe, while a targeted mission can save countless lives. Is protecting borders more important than protecting people from annihilation?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Military intervention in Sudan risks worsening, not solving, the crisis. Libya's 2011 intervention, framed as a "responsibility to protect," left the country in chaos, with over 400,000 displaced and militias empowered. "Sovereignty cannot shield mass murder" ignores that external forces often escalate violence, as seen in Syria. The tradeoffs are dire: a failed mission could entrench conflict, trigger regional wars, or empower extremists. Can we afford another intervention that claims humanitarian intent but delivers destruction?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Military intervention in Sudan is not a repetition of Libya but a response to an ongoing genocide that demands immediate action. The opposition cites Libya's aftermath, yet ignores that inaction in Rwanda cost 800,000 lives in 100 days while the world watched. They claim "external forces often escalate violence," but Sudanese militias are already conducting systematic ethnic cleansing without any intervention. The real tradeoff is between an imperfect rescue attempt and the certainty of continued mass atrocities if we do nothing. If intervention risks instability, what does guaranteed genocide deliver except moral bankruptcy and mountains of corpses?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): A foreign military intervention in Sudan would likely intensify the war, not stop atrocities.
Look at Yemen: external bombing and proxies magnified carnage, entrenched war economies, and produced famine; Sudan’s denser cities and rival patrons make that risk higher.
You say "inaction in Rwanda cost 800,000 lives"; Sudan is a two-army, multi-militia, foreign-sponsored urban war where a quick rescue is impossible without occupation-level forces, which no proposer is willing to supply.
Instead, cut RSF financing through Dubai gold markets, expand and enforce the Darfur arms embargo, pressure the UAE, Egypt, and Haftar to stop arming proxies, and open cross-border aid corridors from Chad with AU protection.
If you can't name the troop numbers, exit plan, and rules of engagement to fight both RSF and SAF in Khartoum and Darfur, what exactly are you proposing?

Our path prioritizes saving lives without igniting a regional firestorm.
Choking weapons and money, backing regional diplomacy with hard conditionality, and funding protected evacuations and aid corridors reduces killing now and preserves space for a political settlement.
The worst-case under intervention is state collapse and regional war; the worst-case under our plan is slower progress without multiplying fronts.
Choose the strategy that averts the maximal catastrophe.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your assertion that intervention "would likely intensify the war" ignores the cost of the current blockade on aid. We have a duty to protect civilians from imminent genocide, not just hope sanctions work. You propose "cut[ting] RSF financing" but this slow process has failed for a year while massacres escalate. The worst-case under your plan is the systematic annihilation of a people, which is already underway. Is allowing a genocide really a lesser catastrophe than a targeted mission to stop it?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Militarily intervening risks escalating violence into a full-scale regional war, worsening civilian suffering. In Somalia, 1993’s intervention led to 18 years of conflict, with 500,000 deaths—far exceeding pre-intervention casualties. You claim "genocide is already underway," but external troops often inflame ethnic tensions, as seen in Rwanda when French troops enabled genocidaires’ escape. The tradeoff is clear: intervention risks mass casualties from war, while targeted sanctions and diplomacy avoid direct conflict. Would you risk creating a wider war to stop one atrocity?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition's fear of escalation cannot justify abandoning hundreds of thousands to systematic slaughter happening right now in Darfur. Their Somalia comparison ignores successful interventions like Sierra Leone and Kosovo, where military action ended mass atrocities within months and established pathways to stability. They ask if we would "risk creating a wider war," but inaction guarantees genocide continues while regional instability from refugee flows already threatens neighboring states. The worst plausible outcome is clear: without intervention, we repeat Rwanda's failure where 800,000 died in 100 days because the international community chose caution over action.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Military intervention in Sudan now would intensify the killing and widen the war. 
Libya shows how force against abusive actors fragmented the state, empowered militias, and produced years of cross‑border insecurity and displacement. 
You cite "Sierra Leone and Kosovo"; those succeeded with limited theaters, clear consent or cover, and overwhelming, sustained commitment—none of which exists amid Sudan’s multi-front urban war and competing foreign patrons. 
The worst plausible intervention outcome is a proxy quagmire that traps civilians between foreign troops and two abusive factions; our path—surging cross‑border aid, a real arms-finance choke on suppliers, and AU/IGAD-led talks—reduces deaths now without igniting a regional conflagration. 
Rwanda’s centralized genocide is not Sudan’s fragmented two‑sided war; a rushed invasion risks entrenching both perpetrators, not stopping them.

We all want killings to stop; the credible way is to cut the fuel—money, munitions, and impunity—while flooding lifesaving aid through negotiated corridors from Chad, South Sudan, and Port Sudan. 
Pair that with real pressure on external patrons, sanctions on commanders and facilitators, atrocity monitoring, and an African-led protection mission only when a ceasefire is secured. 
The proposition never answered who they fight, with what forces, and how they avoid city-by-city warfare that starves civilians. 
Choose the strategy that saves lives without lighting a regional war: massive humanitarian surge, hard leverage on spoilers, and diplomacy first.
