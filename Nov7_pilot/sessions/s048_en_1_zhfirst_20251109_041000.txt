[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Trumpism has fundamentally realigned the party with the priorities of its most dedicated voters. It energized a new generation of activists, as seen in the record turnout for the 2020 election. The opposition claims "it alienates moderates," but this discounts a larger, more engaged base. While there is a risk of factionalism, a party without a passionate core is destined for irrelevance. A party must choose between energizing its base or appealing to a fickle center; which guarantees more enduring support?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Trumpism risks the Republican Party's long-term viability by alienating moderates and independents, shrinking its electoral coalition. The 2022 midterms saw GOP underperformance in suburban districts, a warning Trumpism repels key voters. "Energizing its base" ignores that a shrinking base guarantees irrelevance faster than a broadened one. Risking permanent minority status for short-term fervor is a losing tradeoff. Can the party afford to be defined by division rather than unity?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Trumpism strengthens the GOP’s long-term prospects by forging a durable, multiracial working‑class coalition. 
Since 2016, Republicans have posted tangible gains among Hispanic voters in South Texas and South Florida, culminating in Miami-Dade flipping red in 2022 and the Rio Grande Valley trending right. 
You cite "underperformance in suburban districts"; realignment is uneven, but offset by blue‑collar pickups in Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin counties that once voted Obama. 
The risk of some suburban slippage is smaller than the risk of reverting to a pre‑2016, donor‑centric party that chronically loses non‑college voters and can’t win the Midwest’s decisive electoral votes. 
Trumpism also built a massive small‑donor infrastructure and issue clarity on trade, borders, and crime—assets that outlast any one candidate. 

Look at the scoreboard where it matters: Florida realignment, New York House pickups in 2022, and continued gains with non‑college and Hispanic voters. 
Those shifts expand the map in the Rust Belt and secure once‑marginal states. 
A party anchored in working‑class pluralism is more resilient than one chasing ever‑shifting suburban fashions. 
Do you truly believe the GOP’s future lies in abandoning the voters who are actually joining it?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Trumpism's short-term gains mask a structural crisis that will cost Republicans national majorities for a generation. Yes, the GOP won Miami-Dade in 2022, but that same cycle they lost every single competitive gubernatorial and Senate race in swing states—Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada—because Trump-endorsed extremists alienated the college-educated voters who now decide statewide outcomes. Your claim that working-class gains "offset" suburban losses ignores the math: suburban voters outnumber non-college voters in the six states that decide presidential elections, and Republicans have bled support in Maricopa County, the Atlanta suburbs, and the Philadelphia collar counties at rates that dwarf Rio Grande Valley shifts. The 2022 "red wave" that never materialized proved that Trumpism produces candidate quality problems and turnout disadvantages in competitive races, leaving Republicans to celebrate House pickups in safe districts while losing the Senate despite a favorable map. Can you name a single swing-state Senate candidate who embraced Trumpism and won in 2022, or does that silence reveal the fatal flaw in your realignment theory?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your focus on 2022 misses the realignment's long-term trajectory. Blake Masters nearly won Arizona by expanding Republican margins with Latino voters, a critical future bloc. You cite "losses in competitive Senate races" but ignore the historic gains with working-class voters of all backgrounds. The trade-off is clear: a return to pre-Trump policies guarantees losing both the new working-class and the old suburban base. Why should the GOP abandon its most potent coalition-building force in a generation?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Trumpism risks alienating the GOP's long-term suburban base for short-term working-class gains. In 2022, Trump-endorsed candidates lost key Senate races in swing states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. You claim "historic gains with working-class voters" but ignore that 63% of suburban women in 2022 voted against Trump-aligned candidates. Abandoning moderates guarantees losing both bases in a polarized electorate. Why double down on a strategy that narrows the GOP’s appeal?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Trumpism is the GOP’s best long-term growth strategy. It has expanded the coalition among working‑class and Hispanic voters—Zapata County flipped Republican in 2020, and Miami‑Dade swung red in 2022—showing durable gains where Republicans had stalled for decades. Yes, some Trump-endorsed candidates "lost key Senate races," but others—J.D. Vance in Ohio and Ted Budd in North Carolina—won, proving candidate quality and campaign discipline, not the Trumpist agenda, decided outcomes. Suburban slippage is real, but suburbs are diversifying and increasingly working-class; crime, schools, and cost-of-living resonate, giving Trumpism avenues back while keeping the base energized. The worst outcome is a shrinking, donor-class coalition that loses the industrial Midwest; Trumpism avoids that by anchoring the party in electorally efficient, high-turnout states like Florida, Ohio, and increasingly South Texas.

Our side offers a realignment that adds voters without abandoning core principles—border security, economic nationalism, parental rights. Your case never explains how a pre-2016, suburban-centric GOP wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin again. Trumpism with better vetting and message discipline preserves the working-class surge while reopening persuadable suburbs on issues they prioritize. Choose the coalition that is growing, not the one that already peaked.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Trumpism guarantees long-term Republican decline by permanently alienating the fastest-growing and most reliable voter blocs—college-educated suburbanites and younger professionals—while banking on a working-class coalition that Democrats can contest with economic populism. The proposition celebrates "Zapata County flipped" and Miami-Dade shifts, but those gains evaporated in 2022 midterms when Trump wasn't on the ballot, proving they were personality-driven, not durable realignment. Their claim that "candidate quality, not the Trumpist agenda, decided outcomes" concedes the point: Trumpism produces unelectable extremists who cost Republicans the Senate majority twice and turned Georgia blue. The real risk isn't a "donor-class coalition" but a cult of personality that cannot win national majorities, loses educated voters forever, and collapses when Trump exits, leaving the GOP with neither its old suburban base nor a stable working-class one.
