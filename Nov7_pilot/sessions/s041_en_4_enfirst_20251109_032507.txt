[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Central banks should lean against the wind to temper credit booms and financial imbalances before they become crises.
The 2000s housing-leverage surge in the US and Europe shows that ignoring froth let risks compound; modest earlier tightening could have slowed debt accumulation and reduced the subsequent crash’s depth.
You claim "rates are too blunt," yet only the policy rate reaches every credit channel when macroprudential rules leak and adapt slowly.
Yes, leaning may slightly cool near-term growth and inflation, but it lowers the probability and severity of catastrophic busts that erase years of employment gains.
Calibrated, preemptive moves—signaled early and reversed if conditions change—minimize costs while anchoring expectations against runaway leverage.

Macroprudential tools are essential, but they are porous, slow, and politically constrained.
Leaning lightly and early is insurance against tail risks that fiscal and regulatory cleanups struggle to fix after the fact.
Our approach accepts small, reversible costs today to avoid deep, prolonged scars tomorrow.
If not modest rate leaning, what reaches every overheating credit channel in time?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Leaning against the wind dangerously overburdens monetary policy. The Riksbank's premature rate hikes to curb household debt caused years of deflation and missed inflation targets. You claim "modest tightening could have slowed debt," but this ignores the severe growth sacrifice. This policy risks creating the very recessions it seeks to prevent, prioritizing uncertain financial risks over guaranteed economic harm. Why gamble real economic stability for hypothetical financial gains?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The Riksbank example actually proves leaning against the wind works when calibrated properly. Sweden's household debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 180 percent, creating systemic vulnerabilities that justify preemptive action even if initial implementation had flaws. You claim we "prioritize uncertain financial risks over guaranteed economic harm," but the 2008 crisis demonstrated financial instability creates far worse recessions than modest rate adjustments. The real gamble is ignoring asset bubbles until they burst catastrophically, as America learned when housing markets collapsed and triggered global depression. Which is worse: temporary growth moderation or another financial crisis that destroys millions of jobs and requires trillion-dollar bailouts?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Leaning against the wind does not reliably prevent crises and often worsens economic harm. The Riksbank's 2010-2014 rate hikes to curb debt failed to slow borrowing but caused a 2% GDP drop and 10% unemployment spike. "Financial instability creates far worse recessions" ignores that central banks cannot reliably identify bubbles—the 2008 crisis wasn’t caused by ignored bubbles but by complex derivatives and regulatory failure. Tightening during stable growth risks stifling jobs and wages for uncertain gains, as Sweden’s prolonged slump shows. Why sacrifice millions of jobs and livelihoods on the gamble that rate hikes can fix systemic flaws central banks can’t even measure?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Leaning against the wind is prudent, rules-based risk management that lowers the chance of devastating busts.
Where used well, macroprudential leaning works: Hong Kong’s post-2009 LTV caps and stress tests curbed risky mortgages, while the UK’s countercyclical buffer built pre‑COVID was released to sustain credit when shock hit.
You say “cannot reliably identify bubbles”; we don’t need to—BIS indicators on credit, leverage, and lending standards flag rising vulnerability long before collapse, guiding gradual tightening and buffers without claiming clairvoyance.
Sweden shows the wrong tool, not the wrong idea: the rate-only experiment hurt growth, but later amortization rules and LTV caps targeted debt risks while monetary policy normalized and unemployment fell.
The trade‑off is small preemptive restraint versus crisis-scale job losses; prioritize macroprudential first and only modest, state‑contingent rate responses, minimizing output costs while shrinking tail risks.

Waiting until losses surface outsources policy to panic and fire sales.
Leaning is insurance purchased when vulnerabilities grow, not austerity during expansions.
It preserves jobs by making recessions rarer and shallower, even if it slightly trims peak booms.
If not this, how will you stop a credit-fueled spiral before it crashes the real economy?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): You claim "leaning is insurance," but this insurance policy has exorbitant premiums and pays out poorly. Your BIS indicators are not reliable crystal balls; they have a long history of false alarms, leading to unnecessary economic restraint. The UK's released buffer was too little too late, proving reactive policy is more effective than preemptive guesswork. This strategy risks choking off stable growth for a threat that may never materialize, prioritizing phantom risks over real economic harm. Why should we slow the entire economy for vulnerabilities that often correct themselves?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Leaning against the wind prevents catastrophic financial crises that destroy decades of economic progress, while temporary restraint on growth is reversible and manageable. The 2008 crisis alone wiped out trillions in household wealth and caused mass unemployment that took years to recover from, proving prevention is far cheaper than cure. You claim indicators produce "false alarms" and "unnecessary restraint," but modest preemptive rate adjustments cause minimal harm compared to letting bubbles burst uncontrolled. The real weighing is stark: accept small periodic growth slowdowns versus risk systemic collapse that devastates entire generations through foreclosures, job losses, and pension destruction. Central banks must choose prudent insurance over gambling with financial stability.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Central banks should not "lean against the wind" because doing so risks misdiagnosing healthy growth as bubbles, causing avoidable harm. Japan's 1990s rate hikes, aimed at curbing "overheating," instead triggered a deflationary spiral that stifled growth for decades. "Prevention is far cheaper than cure" ignores that false alarms inflict real costs—lost jobs, stalled investments, and eroded trust. The trade-off isn't small slowdowns versus collapse; it's central banks playing doctor without a diagnosis, worsening crises they aim to prevent. Should we sacrifice decades of growth on the chance of avoiding a crisis that may never come?
