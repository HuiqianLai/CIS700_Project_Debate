[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Banning defensive measures against hostile takeovers will unlock shareholder value and prevent entrenched management from avoiding accountability. When executives deploy poison pills and staggered boards, they prioritize job security over maximizing returns for the actual owners of the company. Studies of successful hostile takeovers consistently show improved operational efficiency and stock performance because new management eliminates wasteful practices that insiders refused to address. While critics will claim this creates short-term instability, the real risk is allowing incompetent leadership to destroy long-term value while hiding behind defensive barriers. Should shareholders who risk their capital be denied the right to accept premium offers simply because current management fears replacement?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Defensive measures against hostile takeovers should not be banned; they protect companies from short-term raiders and preserve long-term strategic value. When Carl Icahn targeted Clorox in 2011, its poison pill defense allowed management to reject a rushed bid, focusing instead on innovation and market expansion. "Unlock shareholder value" ignores that raiders often strip assets, leaving companies weaker. The risk of incompetent leadership is lower than the harm of disrupting research, employee morale, or customer trust during hostile takeovers. Would you let short-term profit destroy a company’s future?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Ban defensive measures; decisions on unsolicited bids should rest with shareholders, not managers.
When Yahoo blocked Microsoft with entrenchment tactics, it later sold its core business for far less—an avoidable, board-created value loss.
You say they "protect companies from short-term raiders"; the UK’s Rule 21 effectively bans frustrating actions, yet deals still require shareholder approval, boards negotiate hard, and markets have not been hollowed out by asset strippers.
Worst case for our side is a bad acquirer wins, but shareholder acceptance, fiduciary duties, antitrust review, and appraisal rights blunt that; worst case for theirs is entrenched managers indefinitely block bona fide premiums and entrench underperformance—losses that cannot be recouped.
Clorox’s pill didn’t safeguard innovation; it denied owners a vote and insulated executives whose incentives are to keep their jobs, not maximize transferable value.

Banning defenses re-centers control with the principals—the shareholders—and restores the disciplining force of the market for corporate control.
It still allows boards to inform, to seek competing bids, and to negotiate terms, without unilaterally locking the doors.
The alternative is a world where agency costs eclipse opportunity, and real owners are sidelined whenever managers feel threatened.
If the owners want the offer, who are managers to say no?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The previous speaker claims banning defenses "re-centers control with the shareholders." This ignores how it actually empowers coercive bidders over all other owners. When Air Products launched a hostile bid for Airgas, its poison pill gave the board time to prove the offer was inadequate, ultimately securing a 50% higher value for shareholders. They claim "losses cannot be recouped" from entrenchment, but a forced sale's permanent loss is far worse than a replaceable board. The worst case is not a bad acquirer but a good one being forced away, destroying unique company value forever for all owners. Should shareholders really be forced to accept a bid that fundamentally undervalues their company's future?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The Airgas case proves our point, not theirs. That 50% premium only materialized because market pressure eventually forced the board's hand, demonstrating shareholders needed protection from their own board's resistance, not the bidder. They say "a forced sale's permanent loss is far worse," but this assumes boards accurately identify undervaluation rather than protecting their positions. The real risk isn't losing theoretical future value, but certain present exploitation when entrenched managers destroy billions in shareholder wealth while immune from accountability. Why should we trust boards who face no consequences for being wrong over shareholders who bear all the financial risk?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Banning defensive measures harms shareholder value by enabling coercive takeovers. In the Kinder Morgan takeover of El Paso, the board's ability to negotiate delayed the deal, securing a 37% premium instead of a rushed 28% bid. You claim "boards accurately identify undervaluation," but El Paso's board faced lawsuits for rushing the sale. Defensive tools let boards balance short-term pressure with long-term value. Without them, shareholders risk permanent losses from hasty sales. Why strip boards of tools that have proven to maximize premiums?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): We should ban takeover defenses because they entrench managers, distort bidding, and deny shareholders a free choice in the only discipline that reliably checks underperformance.
When Microsoft offered about $33 per share for Yahoo in 2008, the board’s defenses helped block it; years later, Yahoo sold core assets to Verizon for a fraction, destroying shareholder value.
You say defenses "maximize premiums"; El Paso’s sale was riddled with conflicts—Goldman’s Kinder Morgan ties and a CEO eyeing a management buyout—criticized by Delaware’s court, showing defenses can entrench insiders and steer outcomes rather than unlock genuine competition.
The worst case with defenses is years of blocked, value-creating bids and coercive lock-ups; without defenses, we mitigate rushed sales via mandatory bidding windows, full disclosure, majority-of-shares tender conditions, and shareholder votes, preserving choice while eliminating management vetoes.
Shareholder choice, not managerial vetoes, should determine control contests and pricing.

This debate is about who decides corporate control—owners or incumbents.
The opposition never solved the core agency problem; El Paso and Yahoo show how defenses amplify conflicts and foreclose better bids, while litigation after the fact rarely restores lost value.
We acknowledge trade-offs, but bidder safeguards—cooling-off periods, auction rules, and majority tenders—prevent coercion without handing managers a veto over owners.
Return control to shareholders and let competition set the price—ban defensive measures.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our position empowers shareholders, who are the true owners of the corporation. The opposition's claim that defenses "entrench managers" ignores how a ban would force immediate sales, preventing boards from seeking higher bids. Without defenses, shareholders face a coerced choice from a single, low-ball offer. The worst outcome is not entrenchment, but the permanent loss of value from a fire sale, which our side prevents by allowing boards to fulfill their duty to maximize value for the owners. The power to say "no" is essential to getting a better "yes."
