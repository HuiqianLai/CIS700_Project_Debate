[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): A citizen welfare standard better serves the public interest. It ensures policies protect fundamental rights like healthcare access, not just market efficiency. Opponents claim this "stifles economic dynamism," yet this prioritizes profits over people. Focusing solely on consumer choice risks catastrophic inequality and social unrest. Shouldn't our ultimate goal be a just and stable society for all?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Consumer welfare standards deliver superior outcomes by maintaining clear, measurable criteria that prevent arbitrary government intervention and protect competitive markets. When regulators focus on price, quality, and output effects, they create predictable rules that encourage innovation and investment across all sectors. 

My opponents claim we "prioritize profits over people," but consumer welfare directly measures tangible benefits: lower prices, better products, and expanded choices that help everyone, especially low-income households. Vague citizen welfare standards inevitably empower bureaucrats to impose subjective preferences, creating regulatory uncertainty that chokes entrepreneurship and reduces the economic growth necessary for funding social programs.

The real catastrophic outcome is adopting expansive standards that paralyze markets through endless litigation over undefined "fundamental rights." If consumer welfare is insufficient, why have countries using this standard consistently achieved higher living standards and technological progress than heavily regulated economies?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): We should prefer a citizen welfare standard because price‑centric antitrust is blind to harms to workers, privacy, and democratic resilience. 
The Facebook–WhatsApp merger was approved because the service was “free,” yet it enabled cross‑platform data exploitation and privacy erosion—real harms the consumer‑welfare lens failed to register or remedy. 
You tout “clear, measurable criteria”; yet rule‑of‑reason enforcement yields years of dueling economists and erratic outcomes in hospital and platform cases, the opposite of clarity for innovators or entrants. 
The risk trade‑off is this: consumer welfare’s myopia entrenches gatekeepers controlling data, wages, and speech; citizen welfare sets ex‑ante, legislated constraints (e.g., self‑preferencing, data‑tying, no‑poach bans) that reduce discretion and litigation while opening markets to entrants. 
If “lower prices, better products” were enough, why did zero‑price dominance, non‑competes, and no‑poach cartels proliferate until enforcers moved beyond consumer‑price tests?

Citizen welfare clarifies the objective: protect people as workers, users, and citizens, not just shoppers, and guard essential rights like privacy and fair opportunity. 
It operationalizes this with bright‑line, predictable rules and audits, not ad hoc preferences, as seen in Germany’s Section 19a and the EU Digital Markets Act’s faster remedies. 
That framework preserves innovation by preventing gatekeeper foreclosure and expanding interoperable, contestable markets. 
Choose the standard that limits catastrophic concentration, aligns enforcement with democratic values, and delivers durable prosperity for everyone.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Consumer welfare standards better protect long-term societal interests by preventing overreach that stifles innovation. The EU’s Digital Markets Act, cited as a citizen welfare success, has already faced criticism for freezing competition in messaging apps—exactly the opposite of “expanding contestable markets.”  
“Citizen welfare sets ex-ante, legislated constraints” ignores how rigid rules can entrench incumbents by freezing evolving markets, as seen in EU telecom regulations that delayed 5G rollout.  
Tradeoffs matter: consumer welfare’s flexibility allows adaptability to new harms, while citizen welfare’s bright-line rules risk locking in outdated solutions that harm workers and users more than they help.  
If “predictable rules” are the goal, why have Germany’s Section 19a and the DMA faced legal challenges for over-broad bans that reduce consumer choice?  
Isn’t it riskier to trade dynamic markets for static rules that may worsen the problems they aim to solve?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your rebuttal misrepresents the DMA's purpose and effect. The DMA prevents tech giants from unfairly leveraging their dominance across markets. Your claim of "freezing competition" ignores how interoperability rules actually create new opportunities for smaller competitors. Rigid rules are necessary to counter platforms' systemic conflicts of interest. Isn't the greater risk allowing unchecked private power to dictate market evolution?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): The DMA's rigid rules demonstrably harm innovation more than they enable competition. When the EU forced Apple to allow third-party app stores, security researchers immediately identified increased malware risks and user confusion, undermining the integrated ecosystem consumers actually prefer.

You claim interoperability "creates opportunities," but mandated technical standards force platforms to expose proprietary systems, directly subsidizing competitors who free-ride on billion-dollar R&D investments. This punishes success rather than addressing actual consumer harm.

Your framing of "unchecked private power" ignores that these platforms gained dominance by delivering superior consumer value—low prices, convenience, and continuous improvement. Consumer welfare standards already address monopolistic abuse through case-by-case analysis without sacrificing the dynamic efficiency that drives technological progress.

The greater risk is locking in today's market structure through prescriptive regulation that prevents disruptive innovation. History shows antitrust enforcement works best when flexible: why should bureaucrats pre-emptively design market architecture rather than let competition and consumer choice guide evolution?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Choose the citizen welfare standard because markets should serve people as workers, voters, and neighbors—not just shoppers—and policy must weigh privacy, labor dignity, resilience, and pluralism alongside prices.
Open standards have expanded welfare without killing innovation—email interoperability, number portability, USB‑C, and UK Open Banking enabled entry, reduced lock‑in, and cut e‑waste; claims that "consumers actually prefer" closed ecosystems conflate comfort with coercion, fixable via notarization, sandboxing, and liability while preserving choice.
Requiring baseline interoperability doesn’t "punish success"; it curbs bottleneck rents and prevents private governments from taxing rivals’ innovation, and the worst risk on our side is modest implementation friction, while theirs is enduring concentration that erodes privacy, labor standards, and democratic resilience.
If low prices can coexist with surveillance, precarity, and gatekeeper vetoes, the consumer-welfare lens is looking the wrong way; center citizen welfare so innovation serves society, not the other way around.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The consumer welfare standard remains the better guide for policy, ensuring innovation thrives while protecting against abuse. When the UK forced Open Banking, fintechs like Monzo boomed—but only because they competed on price, speed, and service, not mandated access. "Centers citizen welfare so innovation serves society" ignores that top-down mandates risk stifling the very innovation needed to solve privacy or labor issues. Consumer welfare’s risks—concentration, surveillance—are addressable through antitrust, not by abandoning a framework that lets markets test solutions. Can we really trust regulators to define "citizen welfare" without killing the competition that drives progress?
