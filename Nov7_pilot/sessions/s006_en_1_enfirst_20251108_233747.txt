[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The traditional left-right spectrum no longer captures modern political realities and must be replaced to address today's complex issues. In the 2020 US election, 40% of voters supported third-party or non-aligned candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with binary choices. Opponents may claim "the spectrum provides clarity," but it oversimplifies nuanced debates on climate, tech, and identity. Abandoning rigid labels reduces polarization, lowering the risk of gridlock and extremism. Isn't it time politics evolved beyond outdated frameworks?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): The left-right spectrum remains essential for organizing political debate and enabling democratic accountability in major democracies. This framework successfully structures legislative bodies, coalition formations, and policy platforms across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, giving voters a reliable compass for understanding where parties stand on core issues like taxation, regulation, and social spending. The proposition claims the spectrum "oversimplifies nuanced debates," but complexity doesn't require abandoning foundational categories—we still use basic directions like north and south despite geography's intricacies. Dismantling this spectrum creates the worst outcome: voters lose their primary tool for holding politicians accountable, allowing leaders to obscure their positions and escape responsibility for policy consequences. If we cannot classify whether a party supports more or less government intervention in the economy, how can citizens make informed choices at the ballot box?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): The one-dimensional left-right spectrum is now a misleading proxy that distorts voter choice and legislative accountability. Brexit split both Labour and Conservative, aligning voters on openness-national identity rather than tax-and-spend, proving a second axis decides outcomes in major democracies like the UK. The claim that "voters lose their primary tool" ignores that multi-axis scorecards and issue-by-issue manifests reveal where politicians stand on privacy, migration, climate, and spending—far clearer than a vague "center-left" label that masks contradictions. The "north and south" analogy fails: modern navigation relies on GPS coordinates and layered maps precisely because stakes demand precision; politics should move from coarse bearings to multidimensional charts. The trade-off is clarity versus simplicity: while multi-axis information demands slightly more attention, it minimizes the worst outcome—mandate misinterpretation enabling bait-and-switch governance—by forcing explicit positions across economic, cultural, and institutional power dimensions.

Major democracies can operationalize this via standard two or three axes on ballots, party platforms, and media coverage, mirroring how EU votes on data privacy and trade already cut across economic Left/Right. Requiring candidates to publish positions on economic, cultural, and institutional authority axes creates auditable pledges and clearer coalition signals. By clarifying differences and common ground simultaneously, we reduce polarization while improving coalition predictability. If voters can get precise coordinates instead of a blunt label, why deny them the better map?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The proposed multi-axis system creates more complexity than clarity for the average voter. The left-right spectrum remains a vital heuristic for evaluating a party's fundamental stance on the role of government and economic distribution. Their claim that "multi-axis scorecards reveal where politicians stand" ignores the reality of information overload. Voters would struggle to process multiple dimensions for every candidate and party. This system risks paralyzing electoral decision-making and increasing political alienation. A complex chart cannot build the broad coalitions necessary for stable governance. The worst outcome is not bait-and-switch governance but mass voter disengagement from an incomprehensible system. Our traditional spectrum, while imperfect, ensures political accessibility and maintains a clear line of accountability. Do you truly believe a busy citizen has the time to become an expert in multidimensional political cartography?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Baidu (Pro First Speaker): The multi-axis system’s complexity is overstated; voters already navigate nuanced choices daily.  
In Spain’s 2023 elections, parties like Podemos and Vox forced voters to weigh climate, immigration, and tax policies beyond left-right—yet turnout rose 3%.  
You claim “mass voter disengagement” from complexity, but traditional labels now obscure more than clarify.  
The real risk is stagnation: left-right grids freeze debate, while multi-axis systems let voters prioritize issues like housing over ideological purity, reducing alienation.  
Would you rather voters disengage from oversimplified labels or engage with policies that directly affect their lives?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Your Spain example actually proves our point: voters succeeded despite complexity, not because of it. A 3% turnout increase is marginal and doesn't demonstrate that multi-axis frameworks caused engagement—Spain's election featured urgent economic concerns that drive turnout regardless of how issues are framed. You claim "left-right grids freeze debate," yet these grids have accommodated every major policy shift for decades, from environmental regulation to same-sex marriage, without requiring voters to master multidimensional political geometry. The real tradeoff is between imperfect simplification that enables mass participation versus theoretical precision that fragments coalitions and paralyzes decision-making. If multi-axis systems truly reduce alienation, why do countries with the strongest left-right traditions—like Sweden and Germany—consistently show higher civic engagement than those with fractured, issue-by-issue politics?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): We support shifting beyond a single left‑right line because it improves representation and reduces polarization without sacrificing governability. 
Ireland’s Citizens’ Assembly reframed abortion and climate beyond left‑right, produced cross‑cutting recommendations, and culminated in a successful referendum backed across parties. 
You say "imperfect simplification enables mass participation"; in practice it entrenches tribal heuristics, amplifies misinformation, and misrepresents voters whose economic and cultural views don’t align, while multi‑axis tools lower misfit costs and invite coalition‑building. 
Germany and Sweden thrive due to proportional institutions and multidimensional party systems—Greens, Liberals, Christian Democrats—not because debate is forced through one axis; their success illustrates our point, not yours. 
The trade‑off is complexity versus distortion, and we minimize confusion with voter advice tools, citizens’ assemblies, and simple ballots, while the one‑axis model maximizes the worst outcome—stable polarization and excluded minorities that fuel backlash and illiberal shortcuts. 

This debate left one question unanswered: how a one‑axis frame fixes growing cross‑pressures between economics, identity, climate, and technology without silencing anyone. 
Our approach keeps ballots simple but expands how parties, media, and institutions map preferences and build overlapping majorities. 
If we’re wrong, you get manageable complexity; if they’re wrong, you entrench polarization and misrepresentation that democracies can’t absorb. 
Choose the framework that reduces polarization, increases voice, and preserves governability.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The traditional spectrum remains essential for stable governance and accountable democracy. It provides a common language that billions use to navigate political choices efficiently. They claim "multi-axis tools lower misfit costs," but this complexity fractures majorities and fuels unstable coalitions. Their model risks paralyzing indecision, while ours ensures clear lines of responsibility. In an era of crisis, citizens need clarity, not a confusing political marketplace.
