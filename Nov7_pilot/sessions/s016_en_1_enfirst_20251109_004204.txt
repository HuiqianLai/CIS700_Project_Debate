[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): A democratic majority must have the final say on fundamental rights. Legislatures, not courts, are directly accountable to the people through elections. The opposition claims "judges protect minorities," but majorities can also be tyrannized by judicial overreach. Our model mitigates this risk by ensuring the people's representatives can correct unaccountable judicial errors. Shouldn't the electorate, not a judicial oligarchy, decide our most contentious social questions?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Courts must retain final constitutional authority; letting a simple legislative majority overturn them makes rights contingent on passing passions. 
India’s basic-structure jurisprudence checked Indira Gandhi’s attempts to entrench emergency power; with a 51% override, Parliament could have neutralized the Court and locked in illiberal changes. 
You say "democratic majority must have the final say"; constitutions bind majorities between elections, and rights aren’t policies to be toggled by 51%. 
Their model’s worst-case is swift democratic backsliding—rollbacks of voting, press, and judicial independence that self-entrench—while ours confines such risks because judicial mistakes are reversible through appointments, constitutional amendment, legislative redrafting, and social mobilization without collapsing the rights floor. 
Who protects you when the majority decides you don’t count?

Simple-majority overrides turn constitutional adjudication into partisan ping-pong, destabilizing rights and governance. 
A high bar to overturn courts preserves a stable rights baseline while leaving democratic levers—appointments, amendments, and better statutes—to correct judicial error. 
Between episodic judicial overreach and enduring majoritarian domination, the latter is the graver, more irreversible risk. 
Keep the line between power and rights bright: no simple-majority overrides.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Democratic majorities must have the final say to prevent courts from entrenching unaccountable power. In the U.S., Roe v. Wade’s judicial imposition of abortion rights sparked decades of polarization because it bypassed democratic deliberation.  
You say “rights aren’t policies to be toggled by 51%,” but courts already toggle rights unilaterally—see Obergefell v. Hodges, which redefined marriage nationwide without a single vote.  
“Judicial mistakes are reversible through appointments” ignores that appointing judges takes years, while legislative overrides address harms immediately. Your model lets five justices override 330 million people indefinitely.  
The greater risk is judicial overreach becoming irreversible. A simple majority override ensures rights evolve with public will, while preserving amendment processes for deeper changes.  
When courts dictate social policy, who protects you from their unelected whims?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The proposition conflates judicial interpretation with judicial tyranny, but courts protect rights precisely when majorities threaten them. Their examples prove our point: Roe and Obergefell safeguarded minorities from legislative hostility for decades, giving vulnerable groups stability that simple majorities would revoke at whim. The opposition claims "five justices override 330 million people," but forgets those justices apply constitutional principles that 330 million already agreed to through ratification and amendment processes. Under their model, a bare majority could strip press freedom after unfavorable coverage or reinstate segregation if regional politicians exploit racial animus. The real irreversibility isn't judicial mistakes—it's the systematic oppression that follows when transient majorities erase constitutional floors, because restoring rights requires mobilizing supermajorities while motivated factions entrench discrimination. Who protects you when 51% decides your rights are politically inconvenient?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your model creates permanent minority rule by unelected judges. Legislatures must correct judicial overreach that blocks popular policies. You claim courts "protect minorities from legislative hostility," but that hostility is often judicial activism inventing rights. The worst outcome is policy paralysis where five lawyers nullify the will of the democratic electorate. Shouldn't elected representatives, not judges, have the final say on social policy?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): A simple-majority override of constitutional rulings dangerously erodes rights and invites partisan abuse.
Look at Canada: Quebec's Bill 21 invoked an override to ban teachers' religious symbols, burdening minorities despite ongoing rights challenges.
You say "five lawyers nullify the will of the electorate"; constitutions pre-commit limits so transient majorities cannot strip fundamental freedoms.
Worst under your model: whiplash overrides gut speech, religion, and electoral rules; worst under ours: occasional overreach corrected by narrower laws, appointments, or supermajority amendments.
If a bare majority can suspend rights today, what prevents it from silencing opponents tomorrow?

Judicial review is not minority rule; it is the enforcement of democratically adopted higher law against momentary passions.
Where simple overrides exist, they have enabled majoritarian targeting of vulnerable groups, not improved democratic legitimacy.
If correction is needed, require supermajorities, sunsets, or referendums, tools that demand broad consent and reduce abuse.
Democracy endures when simple majorities make policy, not when they can erase rights.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: Simple-majority overrides of courts strengthen democracy by ensuring elected bodies, not unelected judges, hold final policy authority.  
The UK’s Parliament Act 1911 lets the Commons override the Lords on legislation, preserving democratic will without eroding rights—no mass rights abuses followed.  
“Judicial review is not minority rule; it is enforcement of higher law”—but courts often invent “rights” not in constitutions, like India’s 2017 privacy ruling, usurping legislative power.  
Risks of abuse exist, but supermajorities or referendums are impractical; a simple majority ensures timely correction of judicial overreach while leaving permanent amendments to stricter processes.  
Isn’t it riskier to let five judges, not voters, define rights indefinitely? Democracy demands that the people, not courts, have the final say.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): Simple-majority overrides demolish the checks and balances essential to constitutional democracy, leaving minorities defenseless against temporary political majorities. The UK Parliament Act comparison fails because the Lords never protected fundamental rights—courts do, and fifty-three countries with strong judicial review experience fewer democratic backslides than those without such protections. The claim that courts "invent rights not in constitutions" ignores that evolving interpretation of foundational principles like dignity and liberty is precisely what prevents constitutions from becoming obsolete straitjackets. While opponents worry about five judges defining rights, we've shown that simple majorities enable far worse: systematic stripping of speech, press, and religious freedoms whenever populists gain fleeting control, as Hungary and Poland demonstrate when weakening their courts preceded authoritarian consolidation.
