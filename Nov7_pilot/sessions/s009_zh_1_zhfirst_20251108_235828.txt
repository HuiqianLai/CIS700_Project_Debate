[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Student organizers of the July Revolution must resist the temptation to become professional politicians because doing so will inevitably corrupt the moral purity that made their movement legitimate in the first place. History shows that revolutionary leaders who transition to formal politics—from Egypt's Wael Ghonim to Hong Kong's Joshua Wong—quickly become entangled in compromise, coalition-building, and power struggles that alienate their original supporters. The movement's strength lies in its outsider status and moral clarity; entering the political arena transforms these activists into just another interest group competing for power. When student leaders become politicians, they risk transforming a principled social movement into a vehicle for personal ambition, ultimately betraying the very ideals their followers risked everything to defend. Should we sacrifice the revolution's moral authority for the uncertain promise of electoral influence?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Our society desperately needs the principled leadership these student organizers provide. Their firsthand experience with injustice makes them uniquely qualified to enact meaningful reform from within the system. You claim entering politics "corrupts moral purity," but principled governance requires moral actors. The greater risk is abandoning the political arena to those with no commitment to the revolution's ideals. Shouldn't we want our most courageous citizens shaping our nation's future?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Student organizers should not convert into formal political roles; their highest value is independence and accountability.
Egypt 2011 shows the danger: activists who entered transitional politics were co-opted or sidelined, movements fractured, and authoritarian resurgence followed.
You warn of "abandoning the political arena"; staying outside isn’t abandonment—it’s checks and balance: agenda-setting, candidate vetting, and sustained oversight without trading legitimacy for office.
The worst plausible risk is capture, fragmentation, and repression once leaders must trade favors; separating movement and state minimizes co‑optation while preserving leverage across parties.
Build firewalls—movement charters, public scorecards, and rotating spokespeople—to partner with clean candidates without sacrificing autonomy.

Independence preserves moral capital and bargaining power.
External leadership deters capture, disciplines allies, and protects dissenters.
Let student organizers be watchdogs, negotiators, and agenda‑setters, not office‑seekers.
The revolution needs a compass, not a throne.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Student organizers must transition to formal roles to institutionalize revolutionary gains. South Africa’s ANC Youth League shows how movement-born leaders like Mandela transformed activism into governance, preventing backslide. You claim "separating movement and state minimizes co-optation"—yet Egypt’s 2011 collapse happened precisely because leaders lacked formal power to enforce reforms. Risks exist, but exclusion guarantees irrelevance; integration with checks like term limits and transparency laws better prevents capture. Can movements truly safeguard gains without seats at the table?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Your Mandela analogy fails because the ANC transformed over decades with broad coalitions, not immediate post-revolution capture by youth organizers. Egypt 2011 collapsed not from lacking formal power but from military entrenchment and weak civil society—student politicians couldn't have prevented a coup. You claim "exclusion guarantees irrelevance," yet movements like Poland's Solidarity retained influence through civil society pressure without becoming politicians themselves. The worst outcome isn't losing a parliamentary seat; it's legitimizing authoritarian successors who co-opt revolutionary symbols while dismantling freedoms. If formal power alone prevents backsliding, why did so many former revolutionaries-turned-politicians become the very autocrats they opposed?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): You argue Solidarity "retained influence without becoming politicians," but they directly formed a government. Influence without power is fleeting when institutions are rebuilt. Your fear of co-option ignores the greater danger of a power vacuum filled by anti-democratic forces. The worst outcome is revolutionary ideals being crushed because their champions voluntarily disarmed. Isn't ceding the state to authoritarians the ultimate legitimization of their power?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Organizers should not enter formal politics; their leverage is strongest as autonomous watchdogs anchoring constitutional and accountability constraints. 
After 2000, Serbia’s Otpor! refused to become a party, pivoted to election monitoring and civic pressure, helping oust Milosevic yet constrain successors—preserving pluralism better than a victorious movement fused to the state. 
You say "influence without power is fleeting"; but durable influence comes from codified guardrails—independent commissions, security-sector reform, transparent procurement—and from a mobilized civil society; the antidote to any vacuum is an inclusive caretaker and broad coalition, not novice rulers rebadged as students-turned-ministers. 
Yes, separating movement and state trades speed for safeguards; but it minimizes the worst outcome—a charismatic vanguard capturing the new regime—by creating dual-key accountability: institutions inside, mobilization outside. Choose oversight over office; keep the revolution’s guardians outside the palace.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Claim: Student organizers must transition to formal politics to institutionalize change, not just monitor it.  
Otpor!’s success in Serbia came from both pressuring the state and later influencing policy through formal channels—without that, reforms stalled.  
You say “durable influence comes from codified guardrails,” but guardrails without guardians are empty shells. Who enforces them if not those who built them?  
Risks of “novice rulers” exist, but excluding organizers risks letting elites co-opt reforms—formal roles let them fight from within, balancing oversight and action.  
Would you rather have student-leaders shaping policy or watching from the sidelines as others undo their gains? The answer is clear.
