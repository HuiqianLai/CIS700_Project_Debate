[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): Japan's remilitarization enhances regional stability and global security in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific. China's aggressive expansion in the South China Sea and repeated incursions near Taiwan demonstrate that current deterrence mechanisms are inadequate without a strengthened Japanese defense capability. Critics fear a return to imperial militarism, but modern Japan has maintained democratic institutions and pacifist culture for nearly 80 years, making such regression implausible. The greatest risk is not Japanese rearmament but rather a power vacuum that emboldens authoritarian expansion, threatening free navigation and sovereignty of smaller nations. Can opponents explain how maintaining Japan's current constraints prevents Chinese hegemony when American commitments alone prove insufficient?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Japan should not remilitarize; it would trigger an arms race, inflame regional nationalism, and increase the risk of miscalculation. 
China’s retaliation to South Korea’s THAAD deployment showed how military moves invite economic coercion and rapid counter-deployments; a larger Japanese arsenal would likely prompt missile buildups and more dangerous patrols around the Senkaku and Taiwan. 
You say "American commitments alone prove insufficient"; the answer is not offense-oriented remilitarization but distributed denial—integrated missile defense, coast guard coordination, resilient supply chains, and multilateral sanctions options that raise costs without validating Beijing’s grievance narrative. 
Worst case with remilitarization: Japan becomes a prime first-strike target and allies face entrapment in a Taiwan flashpoint; our approach’s worst case is slower capability growth, but it avoids hair-trigger escalation and preserves critical Seoul-Tokyo cooperation. 
Why pick a path that predictably accelerates an arms race when credible defensive measures and diplomacy can deny coercion without reviving neighbors’ historical fears?

Opposition here is strategic prudence, not denial of threats. 
Build fortress-like, non-provocative defenses, deepen US–Japan–ROK coordination, and wield economic statecraft instead of expanding power-projection and strike capacities. 
That combination sustains deterrence, cohesion, and legitimacy while narrowing escalation ladders. 
A safer Indo-Pacific is one with a strong yet restrained Japan, not a remilitarized one.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition's "non-provocative defense" is dangerously obsolete. A purely defensive Japan cannot deter modern threats like hypersonic missiles or naval blockades. They advocate "distributed denial" but ignore its fatal flaw: missile defense alone is leaky. This approach risks a catastrophic failure in a crisis, while a capable Japanese military provides a reliable deterrent. Would you trust a shield alone if your adversary has already drawn a sword?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Japan's re-militarization risks escalation far more than it deters threats. After WWII, Japan's pacifist constitution prevented regional arms races—its self-defense focus worked for decades. You claim "a shield alone" is risky, but missile defense paired with diplomacy avoids provoking adversaries who might otherwise accelerate attacks. The worst outcome of your plan is nuclear-armed neighbors responding to Japan's expanded military. Which is riskier: a leaky shield or a new arms race?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The "leaky shield" risk far outweighs any hypothetical arms race concern because Japan's current vulnerability invites aggression rather than preventing it. North Korea has fired missiles over Japanese territory multiple times since 2017, demonstrating that pacifism alone cannot deter determined adversaries who exploit Japan's military constraints. You claim "missile defense paired with diplomacy" works, but this ignores that diplomatic efforts have repeatedly failed to stop nuclear developments in the region. Japan's remilitarization under transparent democratic oversight actually stabilizes the balance of power by removing the perception of an easy target, whereas continued weakness encourages miscalculation by aggressive states. If deterrence through strength risks an arms race, why has Japan's current vulnerability failed to prevent North Korea and China from already expanding their arsenals?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Japan’s sweeping remilitarization heightens escalation risks without fixing DPRK/PRC drivers. 
When South Korea deployed THAAD in 2017, China retaliated economically and expanded military posturing—hardware shifts invited countermeasures, not stability. 
Your claim that "current vulnerability invites aggression" ignores that U.S. extended deterrence has prevented attacks on Japan for decades despite North Korean theatrics. 
The worst plausible outcome is a missile-nuclear spiral; calibrated defense plus alliance diplomacy minimizes that, while remilitarization incentivizes DF‑26 buildups, ADIZ expansion, and preemption doctrines. 
What evidence shows Japanese rearmament would halt DPRK nukes rather than trigger Chinese/Russian counterdeployment and renewed coercion like THAAD’s backlash?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position recognizes that regional stability requires proactive deterrence. The THAAD deployment you cite actually proves our point, as it countered a real missile threat. Your claim "hardware shifts invited countermeasures" ignores that aggression, not defense, initiates instability. A purely diplomatic approach risks catastrophic miscalculation by emboldening adversaries, whereas strengthened deterrence prevents conflict. The security of Japan and the entire region depends on a credible defensive posture.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Japan's re-militarization risks escalation, not stability. China's 2016 South China Sea standoff shows how military posturing fuels conflict—diplomacy, not hardware, de-escalated tensions. "Aggression, not defense, initiates instability" ignores how Japan's military buildup could be seen as aggression by neighbors. Risking war over miscalculations outweighs any hypothetical deterrence gains. Will we learn from history or repeat it?
