[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Student organisers should not enter formal politics; their greatest leverage is independence.
Serbia’s Otpor lost credibility and cohesion once leaders turned into party politicians, and the party experiment fizzled, weakening the movement’s anti-corruption pressure.
The opposition says, 'you can't change without power'; but movements wield power through agenda-setting, mass legitimacy, and conditional support, without being captured by party discipline and patronage.
Entering office risks co-optation, factional splits, and targeted repression that discredits the revolution; staying outside risks slower policy wins, but preserves cross-party leverage, unity, and the capacity to check any government.
Independence safeguards the revolution’s principles when parties inevitably bargain them away.

Let student organisers be watchdogs, coalition-builders, and agenda-setters, not office-seekers.
Channel momentum into constitutional guarantees, independent unions, youth councils, and civic oversight bodies that outlast electoral cycles.
This path minimizes the worst outcome: capture or collapse of the movement, while retaining leverage over any ruling coalition.
Why gamble the movement's only irreplaceable asset, its moral authority, for fragile titles?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Claude (Con First Speaker): Real democratic change requires student organisers to claim formal power, not merely influence it from the margins. History shows movements that refuse institutionalization watch others hijack their agenda: Tunisia's revolutionary youth stayed outside while Ennahda and old-regime figures captured elected offices and diluted reforms. The proposition claims movements retain "moral authority" as watchdogs, but moral authority without institutional power becomes mere performance—Bangladesh's student coordinators influenced nothing when entrenched parties ignored their protests for years. Staying outside doesn't preserve leverage; it surrenders the legislative seats, ministerial positions, and policy implementation tools to those who opposed the revolution or will co-opt its symbolism. If student organisers genuinely represent the people's will from the streets, why should they refuse the people's mandate at the ballot box?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our opposition claims refusing power "surrenders the legislative seats." This misunderstands the student movement's unique power, which is its moral credibility. The Arab Spring's revolutionary youth in Egypt who entered politics were swiftly co-opted and discredited by the deep state. Formal politics demands compromise that betrays revolutionary ideals. By remaining watchdogs, they hold any government accountable without being tainted by the inevitable dirty deals of governance. The worst outcome is the complete loss of public trust in the revolution's ideals. Our approach prevents this by preserving the movement's integrity as a permanent guardian of the people's demands. Is a compromised voice inside the system truly more powerful than an incorruptible one outside it?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The claim that student organizers should avoid formal politics to preserve integrity ignores how lasting change requires institutional power. Tunisia’s 2011 revolution succeeded because leaders like Rached Ghannouchi transitioned into governance, ensuring reforms outlasted protests. You argue “compromise betrays ideals,” but abstaining guarantees stagnation—the deep state won’t dismantle itself. Remaining outside risks becoming irrelevant as governments co-opt or crush movements; entering politics forces accountability through policy, not just criticism. Can a revolution truly win without wielding the levers of power it fought to unlock?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Student organizers should not enter formal politics; their comparative advantage is independent oversight, not governing. 
Where they did enter, regimes exploited it—Sudan’s 2019 civilian leaders joined government, and the 2021 coup decapitated the movement’s leadership. 
You say “lasting change requires institutional power,” yet Tunisia’s Ennahda in office couldn’t prevent Saied’s 2021 power grab. 
The worst risk is authoritarian rollback; if activists hold office, repression erases both state reforms and the movement, whereas separation preserves a resilient watchdog able to regroup. 
Power without survivability is a trap—why risk sacrificing the movement’s only irreplaceable asset: its credibility and capacity to mobilize?

Partition roles: students build agendas, monitor, and mobilize; politicians govern under scrutiny. 
This separation kept Otpor impactful after Serbia’s transition, while party-bound activists elsewhere were neutralized. 
Our model minimizes the worst outcomes—co-optation, decapitation, and loss of public trust—while retaining pressure on every government. 
Keep the movement outside to keep the revolution alive.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Claude (Con First Speaker): Your "comparative advantage" framework ignores that oversight without power to implement is performative, not transformative. In Bangladesh 2024, student coordinators who refused formal roles watched their demands get diluted by entrenched politicians who co-opted their legitimacy without accountability. You claim "separation preserves a resilient watchdog," but watchdogs without teeth cannot prevent backsliding—Egypt's April 6 Movement stayed outside and was brutally dismantled anyway while the old guard returned. The real trap is surrendering institutional control to those who caused the crisis, allowing them to hollow out reforms while activists shout from the sidelines. If your model worked, why did separated Czech students watch Klaus's corruption flourish post-Velvet Revolution while integrated Polish Solidarity actually built democratic institutions?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our position prevents the revolution's ideals from being corrupted by the political machine. The opposition claims "watchdogs without teeth cannot prevent backsliding," yet history shows that movements entering politics are devoured by it. The greater risk isn't losing a seat at the table, but becoming another part of the broken system you sought to fix. For genuine, lasting change, moral authority must remain independent from the compromises of formal power.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The claim is clear: student organizers must enter formal politics to turn ideals into actionable policy. Look at Nelson Mandela, who transitioned from activism to presidency and codified equality into law. You say "movements entering politics are devoured by it"—yet Mandela’s government dismantled apartheid. The risk of staying outside is worse: without power, revolutions become footnotes, not foundations. Will you let the system outlast your fight, or seize the tools to reshape it?
