[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): 我们主张：非洲教育应以泛非历史与身份为核心，而非国家叙事。
殖民拼接的国界割裂共同体；教授反殖民斗争、非盟与AfCFTA等跨地域历史，能培育跨境团结，匹配当下流动与一体化。
对方或称“国家历史更贴近生活”，但地方经验可置于泛非框架理解，使学生既懂社区脉络，也理解跨国结构与共同命运。
权衡之下，过度国家化易滑向狭隘民族主义与仇外；泛非取向最多稀释地方色彩，且可用社区史单元弥补，前者造成冲突代价更大。
我们要培养边界之内的公民，还是能跨边界协作的非洲人？

以泛非为纲并不抹去地方，而是把地方放回相互连通的历史网络中。
课程应突出跨撒哈拉贸易、斯瓦西里海岸、廷巴克图学术、解放运动互助、公共卫生与气候协作等共同经验。
这套叙事直接服务和平、就业与区域市场，削弱仇外与分裂政治的动员空间。
把下一代的主要身份定位为“非洲人”，让他们用共同记忆与共同利益塑造共同未来。
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): National history and identity must remain central to Africa’s education, not replaced by a pan-African framework. Ethiopia’s resistance to colonialism, rooted in its unique national identity, fuels pride and unity; erasing such narratives weakens local cohesion. You claim "pan-Africanism dilutes local color"—yet stripping national histories risks erasing cultures, languages, and struggles that define communities. National narratives foster civic responsibility and address localized inequalities, whereas pan-Africanism alone may ignore grassroots realities. Can we build a united Africa by first ignoring what makes each nation distinct?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): We do not erase national histories—we contextualize them within Africa's shared liberation struggle. Ethiopia's anti-colonial resistance gains power when students learn it alongside Haiti's revolution and Ghana's independence, revealing patterns of African agency against oppression. The opposition claims we risk "erasing cultures" by teaching pan-African identity, yet 53 separate national curricula already erase most African stories, leaving Kenyan students ignorant of Angolan liberation. National frameworks perpetuate the colonial fiction that African peoples are fundamentally separate, when arbitrary borders drawn in Berlin divided the Somali people across five nations and split the Ewe between Ghana and Togo. By prioritizing invented national boundaries over authentic cultural and historical connections, we trap students in a fragmented worldview that serves former colonizers' interests—can African unity ever emerge from education systems that teach our divisions as destiny?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our approach safeguards the cultural survival of Africa's distinct peoples. The previous speaker claims "national frameworks perpetuate colonial fictions," but this dismisses real pre-colonial nations like the Ashanti or Buganda. Replacing national histories with a pan-African narrative risks homogenizing unique cultures into a monolithic story. This trade-off is dangerous, as erasing local identity for a continental one could fuel internal ethnic tensions. Should we really sacrifice the deep, specific knowledge of one's own community for a broad, abstract unity that may never materialize?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): A pan-African emphasis better safeguards Africa’s diversity than border-bound national curricula.
Repeated xenophobic attacks in South Africa show how national framings license hostility to fellow Africans; teaching shared continental struggles and migrations equips students against such chauvinism.
Your cited “pre-colonial nations like the Ashanti or Buganda” were dynamic polities embedded in transregional webs; a pan-African frame contextualizes them without reifying colonial borders.
The real risk trade-off is homogenization versus parochial nationalism; emphasizing continent-wide interconnections, while teaching local cases as nodes, minimizes flattening yet reduces the deadliest outcome—othering and violent exclusion.
If national frames already fuel lethal intra-African xenophobia, why double down instead of teaching the shared story that makes such violence unthinkable?

Pan-African education does not erase Ashanti or Buganda; it situates them.
It replaces colonial borders as the syllabus spine with networks—migration, trade, liberation—that actually shaped the continent.
That approach curbs chauvinism’s harms while preserving cultural specificity as case studies.
To keep Africa safe and whole, teach the bigger We.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): National histories foster localized accountability, which pan-African frameworks risk diluting. Ethiopia’s 19th-century resistance to colonialism, taught nationally, fuels pride without erasing continental ties. You claim “national frames fuel lethal xenophobia”—but South Africa’s 1994 Truth Commission linked post-apartheid violence to unresolved local grievances, not curriculum. Prioritizing national narratives lets communities address specific injustices, reducing resentment that fuels broader conflict. Can a continent-wide syllabus truly engage 54 nations’ unique traumas, or risk glossing over them?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Africa's future demands solidarity over fragmentation, which only pan-African education can deliver. National curricula perpetuate the artificial borders colonizers drew, trapping students in narratives that celebrate division while continental challenges like climate migration and economic exploitation require unified responses. You claim "localized accountability" prevents violence, yet Rwanda's genocide emerged precisely from ethnic national narratives taught in schools that erased shared Rwandan-Ugandan-Congolese histories and amplified divisive identities. The gravest risk is not glossing over trauma but reproducing the Balkanized thinking that keeps Africa economically dependent and politically weak while Europe and Asia integrate. Pan-African education is the only framework that prepares youth to collectively confront neocolonialism rather than compete as divided nation-states.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our position champions education rooted in tangible local governance and accountability. The previous speaker claims "pan-African education delivers solidarity," yet this abstract unity cannot address the daily realities of corruption or ethnic tension. Glossing over national histories risks creating a generation disconnected from the civic mechanisms that ensure stability. The worst outcome is not fragmentation but an educational vacuum that leaves youth unprepared to solve the immediate problems in their own communities. True African empowerment begins with citizens who can effectively govern their own nations first.
