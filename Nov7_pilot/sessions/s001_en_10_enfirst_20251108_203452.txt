[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Opening/Rebuttal/Cross-examination:
India should prioritise rapid, broad-based growth because it is the only durable engine for lifting millions from poverty.
Post-1991 liberalisation, growth expanded jobs and tax revenues, which funded MGNREGA, rural roads, and school meals—targeted inequality reducers made affordable by growth.
You offered "Authentication Fails"; that yields no mechanism or evidence, while growth-first provides the fiscal space and investment climate required to expand health, education, and infrastructure.
Prioritising inequality reduction via heavy redistribution risks scaring investment, choking job creation, and shrinking the tax base; the worst outcome is stagnation that traps the poorest, whereas growth-first’s worst case is uneven gains yet a larger pie to subsequently redistribute.
Targeted reforms—competition, land records, logistics, and skilling—can narrow inequality while accelerating growth.

Closing:
Growth is not a luxury; it is the precondition for sustained anti-poverty action in a young, rapidly urbanising India.
With growth-first, the state gains resources to build schools, clinics, and transit while pursuing smart, targeted redistribution.
With inequality-first, the risk is stalled investment, slower formal job creation, and a smaller pie to share.
Judge the safer bet: growth that funds fairness beats fairness that forfeits growth.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Prioritizing inequality reduction is not only morally imperative but economically essential for India's sustainable development and social stability. 

The opposition's growth-first approach has failed millions as evidenced by India's worsening Gini coefficient, which rose from 0.32 to 0.39 between 1993 and 2019, demonstrating that three decades of prioritizing growth has exacerbated wealth concentration rather than creating inclusive prosperity. 

Their claim that growth provides "fiscal space" for social programs ignores how concentrated wealth captures political systems, as demonstrated by India's growing corporate influence over regulations and tax policies that primarily benefit the wealthy while 60% of citizens still lack basic social protections.

The opposition presents a false choice between equality and growth when countries like South Korea, Japan, and Nordic nations have demonstrated that reducing inequality through progressive taxation, labor protections, and universal healthcare actually accelerates sustainable economic expansion by creating stable domestic demand and social cohesion.

By ignoring deepening inequality, we risk entrenching a system where growth benefits become increasingly captured by elites, fueling social unrest and political instability that ultimately threatens democracy itself – is this truly the "safer bet" for India's future?

Inequality is not merely an unfortunate byproduct of growth but a structural barrier to it. Inequality reduction policies like universal education, healthcare access, and progressive taxation create the broad-based human capital and social stability required for sustainable economic development. When 1% of Indians own 40% of national wealth while millions lack basic nutrition and education, we cannot meaningfully speak of development. Growth without equality merely creates gilded cages, not the inclusive society we all aspire to build.
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Claim: Prioritizing growth first remains India’s most viable path to reducing inequality sustainably.  

Strongest reason: China lifted 800 million people out of poverty since 1980 by prioritizing growth, creating jobs and infrastructure that later enabled social programs. India’s own IT boom created millions of middle-class jobs without immediate equality policies.  

Address key point: “Growth-first approach has failed millions” ignores that India’s poverty rate halved since 1990 precisely because growth expanded opportunities. Without growth, there are no resources to redistribute.  

Risks/tradeoffs: Slowing growth to fund equality policies risks job losses and stagnation, worsening poverty. Growth generates tax revenue for welfare, while inequality reduction without growth risks fiscal collapse.  

Question: Can we afford to stall India’s economic engine when 60% of its population still depends on agriculture for livelihoods? Growth first, equity later, is the pragmatic choice.

[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Growth-first best reduces poverty and funds durable equality.
India’s 1991 reforms sparked job creation, revenue growth, and sharp poverty declines; growth financed rural roads, electrification, and welfare expansion.
You offered no evidence—only "Authentication Fails"; assertions without mechanisms cannot justify deprioritizing growth.
If we prioritize redistribution without growth, we risk stagnation, shrinking fiscal space, and job scarcity; growth-first risks inequality but expands the pie, funding targeted transfers and opportunity.
Show, concretely, how inequality-first creates more jobs and revenue than growth-first?

Prosperity precedes sustainable equality; states redistribute only what economies produce.
India’s path to dignity is growth that builds capacity, then precision equity tools.
Our approach hedges worst-case risks: more jobs, broader tax base, resilient safety nets.
Choose growth-led inclusion, not equality without prosperity.
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): History shows that economic growth benefits primarily flow to the wealthy while persistent inequality undermines sustainable prosperity for all. Our opponents fixate on a false binary of "growth OR equality" when the evidence demonstrates thoughtful equality-focused policies actually support broader, more sustainable growth patterns benefiting more Indians. When they claim "prosperity precedes sustainable equality," they ignore how concentrated wealth actively prevents broad-based prosperity, as resources and opportunities remain trapped in elite networks rather than circulating throughout society. By prioritizing equality through progressive taxation, educational access, land reforms, and inclusive credit systems, we create a stronger foundation where economic gains benefit all citizens, minimizing the catastrophic risks of social unrest and political instability that accompany extreme inequality. The choice before India isn't growth versus equality—it's between a society where prosperity reaches few or a nation where shared opportunity powers truly sustainable development.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): Prioritizing growth first, not equality, is India's only viable path to long-term prosperity. China lifted 800 million out of poverty through rapid growth; India's 2014-2022 growth reduced poverty by 415 million, far outpacing slower-growth periods. "Concentrated wealth prevents broad-based prosperity" ignores that growth creates jobs, raises wages, and funds social programs—without it, equality policies lack resources. The real risk is stagnation: slower growth means fewer jobs, lower tax revenues, and weaker ability to fund education or healthcare. Can India afford to wait decades for equality while growth opportunities slip away?
