[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): IMF conditionalities beyond anti-corruption measures trap developing nations in cycles of dependency and poverty. When the IMF imposed structural adjustment programs on Argentina in the 1990s, mandated privatization and austerity deepened inequality and culminated in the 2001 economic collapse. Critics claim conditions ensure fiscal responsibility, but evidence shows they primarily serve creditor interests while undermining national sovereignty and local economic knowledge. The worst outcome under current policy is perpetual underdevelopment as countries sacrifice long-term growth for short-term compliance with one-size-fits-all prescriptions. Why should external technocrats dictate domestic policy when each nation's economic context differs fundamentally?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Our opposition is grounded in the necessity of comprehensive conditionalities for sustainable development. Consider Ghana's 2015 IMF program where governance reforms strengthened public financial management. The previous speaker claims conditions "serve creditor interests," ignoring domestic accountability benefits. Stripping all non-corruption conditions risks irresponsible borrowing and capital flight, undermining poverty reduction itself. Should nations not be required to demonstrate sound economic stewardship to access global funds?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: Removing non-corruption conditions reduces harmful interference while preserving accountability.  

Ghana’s 2015 reforms were imposed during a debt crisis; removing non-corruption conditions avoids repeating austerity that deepened poverty.  

“Stripping all non-corruption conditions risks irresponsible borrowing” ignores that IMF loans already require repayment capacity. Countries can’t borrow irresponsibly if funds are tied to anti-corruption audits.  

Tradeoffs: Excessive conditions delay aid and force austerity, worsening crises. Focusing on corruption minimizes the risk of economic collapse—the worst outcome for poverty.  

Why prioritize political over economic conditions when corruption is the root of mismanagement?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): The motion is dangerous: eliminating all non-corruption conditions would turn the IMF into a no-strings macro bailout, inviting repeat crises. 
Ghana’s 2015 program faltered not because conditions existed, but because fiscal and energy reforms were loosened before elections; without macro anchors, Ghana defaulted in 2022 and needed another program. 
You say, "IMF loans already require repayment capacity," but capacity depends on policy changes—without tariff, FX, and debt conditions, forecasts are fiction and funds can finance capital flight or subsidy holes. 
Yes, excessive micromanagement delays relief, but scrapping macro conditions raises the tail risk of inflation, currency collapse, and disorderly default—the outcomes that devastate the poor and make anti-corruption gains moot. 
If corruption-only loans ignore unsustainable pegs, energy subsidies, and mounting rollover risks, what exactly ensures repayment—and protects citizens when the next balance-of-payments crisis hits?

Keep anti-corruption front and center, but retain limited, high-impact macro conditions: debt sustainability, credible fiscal anchors, energy pricing reform, and exchange-rate unification. 
Pair them with social-protection floors and automatic reviews to avoid austerity overreach and speed disbursement. 
This model minimizes catastrophic failure while curbing interference and preserving national policy space. 
Reform conditionality—don't abolish it.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): You claim "without macro anchors, forecasts are fiction" yet ignore that current comprehensive conditionality has not prevented default cascades. Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Pakistan all completed multiple IMF programs with full structural conditions before sliding back into crisis within years. The real fiction is that technocratic micromanagement from Washington can substitute for domestic political legitimacy and institutional capacity that only anti-corruption measures build over time. Your "limited high-impact macro conditions" still empower external creditors to override elected governments on energy pricing and exchange rates, perpetuating the democratic deficit that fuels populist backsliding. If macro stability truly requires undermining national sovereignty over fiscal policy, why have countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh achieved sustained growth outside rigid IMF frameworks while serial borrowers remain trapped?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Your examples of Vietnam and Bangladesh actually prove our point. They achieved growth precisely by implementing the very structural reforms IMF conditionality promotes. You claim "serial borrowers remain trapped," ignoring how corruption perpetuates their cycles of debt. Without comprehensive reforms, anti-corruption efforts alone cannot stabilize an economy. Your model risks hyperinflation and deeper poverty for the most vulnerable. Do you truly believe a government can fight corruption while its entire economy collapses?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: Removing non-anti-corruption conditions minimizes economic harm while targeting root causes of instability.  
Vietnam’s 1990s reforms, though IMF-driven, left 40% of its population in poverty until anti-corruption measures were prioritized—proof that fewer conditions focus resources better.  
You claim “Without comprehensive reforms, anti-corruption efforts alone cannot stabilize an economy.” Yet Bangladesh’s 2010s growth spiked after dropping non-anti-corruption IMF conditions, proving targeted action works.  
Hyperinflation risks are overstated; Argentina’s 2023 debt restructuring without strict conditions stabilized its currency faster than prior IMF-mandated austerity. The trade-off is clear: fewer conditions reduce poverty spikes.  
Would you rather a nation fight corruption with stable resources or collapse under austerity’s weight? Prioritize anti-corruption, not overreach.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Retaining targeted macro, debt, and social-safeguard conditions alongside anti-corruption is necessary to prevent IMF money from financing instability and repeat crises. 
Sri Lanka’s 2022 rescue worked because disbursements were tied to debt-restructuring milestones, energy-price reforms, and social spending floors—non-anticorruption conditions that restored imports and credibility; removing them would have prolonged shortages and capital flight. 
Your claim that "hyperinflation risks are overstated" ignores Argentina’s persistent triple-digit inflation under loose anchors and Ghana’s pre-program spiral; without fiscal, monetary, and FX conditions, cash injections leak into inflation and dollarization, hurting the poor first. 
By keeping parsimonious, pro-poor conditionality, we minimize the worst plausible outcome—currency collapse and rationing—while still policing corruption; is it prudent to trade macro stability for symbolic purity?
