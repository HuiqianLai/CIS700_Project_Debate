[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The human desire for survival makes eternal life the rational choice for any ordinary individual. Death robs us of all possibilities—relationships, experiences, learning, and personal growth—while immortality preserves our agency to continue pursuing meaning indefinitely. Some fear eternal life would become monotonous, but boredom is far preferable to permanent extinction and can be managed through new experiences across unlimited time. Unlike death which irreversibly ends consciousness and strips away everything we value, immortality allows us to adapt, change priorities, and even choose cessation later if truly desired. Why would any reasonable person choose guaranteed annihilation over the option to continue existing with retained autonomy?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Choosing immortality is not the rational path for ordinary individuals; it risks devaluing life's meaning and intensifying existential despair. History shows finite lives drive urgency—Shakespeare's works emerged from mortality's pressure, not endless time. "Boredom is far preferable to permanent extinction" ignores how monotony erodes autonomy; centuries of sameness could strip choice, not preserve it. The tradeoff of eternal existence risks existential paralysis, while mortality minimizes the worst outcome by ensuring life retains inherent value. Would endless years truly offer freedom, or just a longer sentence in meaninglessness?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): Ordinary individuals are better off choosing immortality because it maximizes agency and option value.  
Death is irreversible, while continued life is reversible—you can later opt out—so immortality safeguards choices in a way mortality cannot.  
Long horizons enable transformative projects: curing diseases you currently face, re-skilling repeatedly, or witnessing humanity expand beyond Earth—opportunities foreclosed by mandatory death.  
You say "mortality minimizes the worst outcome"; in fact, permanent extinction is the worst, and immortality uniquely prevents it while leaving exit options.  
Concerns about centuries of sameness ignore that technology, culture, and identities evolve; boredom is mitigable through self-renewal, therapy, and novel environments.  

The tradeoff is clear: immortality risks malaise; mortality guarantees oblivion.  
Rational risk management favors reversible states over irreversible losses; immortality keeps options open while death forecloses them.  
Even if meaning wavers, time permits recalibration, new commitments, and recovery from despair; mortality denies these adjustments.  
Given one path is fixable and the other final, why choose finality?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): You claim immortality is reversible, but that ignores the immense psychological burden of an endless existence. Consider the universal human need for closure and narrative completion, which mortality provides. Your "reversible—you can later opt out" argument trivializes the profound despair of finding life meaningless over millennia. The worst plausible outcome isn't oblivion, but an inescapable, conscious suffering that you cannot simply opt out of due to basic survival instinct. Why trade a natural ending for a potentially unendurable prison of your own making?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The reversibility argument stands precisely because humans retain agency throughout immortality. Your concern about "unendurable prison" assumes we become passive victims, yet immortality grants continuous capacity for growth, new relationships, and evolving purposes that mortality cuts short. You claim "endless existence" creates despair, but evidence from long-lived individuals shows adaptability—humans find meaning repeatedly across decades, not just once. The worst outcome under mortality is irreversible: talented scientists, artists, and loved ones lost forever with their accumulated wisdom, while immortality allows choice and course correction. If millennia truly became unbearable despite all new experiences available, why would survival instinct override rational evaluation when we've already chosen immortality once?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Claim: Immortality's supposed "choice" is an illusion that masks existential entrapment.  
Strongest reason: Centenarians often describe longevity as bittersweet, not boundless joy—many report loneliness when peers die, not endless growth.  
Address quote: "survival instinct override rational evaluation"  
Rebut: If survival instincts are so malleable, why do humans willingly die for beliefs or loved ones? Instincts aren't infinitely pliable; they have limits.  
Risks: Mortality limits suffering to a finite span; immortality risks infinite despair with no escape, making it the worse outcome.  
Question: When has "choice" ever been truly free when the alternative is eternal oblivion?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Pro Second Speaker): We should choose immortality because it maximizes freedom, option value, and the chance to build meaning.
People recover from grief, switch careers, remarry, and reinvent identities multiple times; longevity amplifies these proven human capacities instead of foreclosing them at an arbitrary age.
You say 'survival instinct override rational evaluation'; yet soldiers, whistleblowers, and martyrs show we can reason past impulse, which strengthens—not weakens—the case for granting individuals a longer runway to choose, learn, and revise without an unavoidable deadline.
Yes, immortality risks boredom and loss; but those are dynamic, improvable problems—new relationships, therapies, memory management, and changing worlds—whereas death guarantees total, irreversible loss of all value.
When the alternative is oblivion, freedom grows with time; choosing immortality preserves agency, whereas choosing mortality extinguishes it in one stroke.

This debate reduces to option value versus certainty of oblivion.
Our side preserves the option to change course; theirs ends the game entirely.
Even if some centuries hurt, additional time gives tools, communities, and knowledge to reduce suffering, while mortality forecloses every cure, apology, and discovery.
Choosing immortality minimizes the worst plausible loss: it keeps tomorrow available.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The previous speaker champions "freedom grows with time," but this confuses quantity with quality. An endless life risks becoming a prison of diminishing returns, where novelty fades and relationships lose their preciousness. They claim immortality "minimizes the worst plausible loss," but it actually maximizes the risk of an intolerable, inescapable existence. Facing the certainty of a meaningful end is far wiser than risking the certainty of endless ennui. Choosing mortality preserves the dignity of a completed story, not an endless sentence.
