[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Our position champions human ingenuity over romanticized nature. Consider life-saving synthetic insulin, which is purer and more accessible than its animal-derived counterpart. Opponents may claim "natural means safer," but arsenic is also perfectly natural. Prioritizing the natural ignores proven benefits and concrete harms, creating needless risk. Should we not judge products by their actual merits rather than their origin?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): The natural world provides irreplaceable safeguards that artificial alternatives often undermine. Take antibiotics: overuse of synthetic versions has bred resistant superbugs, while natural ecosystems maintain microbial balance. "Synthetic insulin is purer" ignores how natural processes evolved checks against overdose. Artificial solutions risk unintended consequences, like chemical runoff poisoning water supplies. Would you trade short-term convenience for irreversible ecological collapse?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The preference for "natural" over "artificial" is a dangerous romanticization that ignores medical reality. Synthetic insulin has saved millions of diabetics worldwide, while relying on animal-sourced insulin caused countless allergic reactions and supply shortages before modern production. The speaker claims "natural processes evolved checks against overdose," but natural belladonna and arsenic kill without any such safeguards—nature provides no inherent safety mechanism. The real risk isn't artificial solutions causing problems, but rather rejecting proven synthetic treatments because of irrational bias, condemning patients to preventable suffering. Should we let children die from bacterial infections because antibiotics aren't "natural enough" for social approval?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): The natural-over-artificial norm is a precautionary heuristic that minimizes systemic, irreversible harm.
From thalidomide to PFAS and leaded gasoline, engineered fixes delivered benefits while inflicting delayed, widespread damage we only recognized after mass exposure.
You say "nature provides no inherent safety mechanism"; true, but coevolved exposures are bounded by long experience, unlike persistent novelties whose externalities often evade trials and regulation.
The trade-off is delayed adoption versus irreversible tail risks; a default natural preference slows diffusion until safety is proven, reducing worst-case harms far more than it costs in short-term delay.
This norm is not prohibition: where evidence is overwhelming—insulin, antibiotics—we already accept synthetic tools while retaining skepticism toward marketing-driven novelties.

Without this social check, corporate and regulatory failures can scale harms faster than we can detect them.
With it, we still get life-saving innovations, but with higher evidentiary thresholds and safer phasing-in.
The worst plausible outcome we avert is irreversible, population-level damage—not a brief wait for proven cures.
So why abandon a heuristic that saves us from rare, catastrophic mistakes?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): You claim this norm "slows diffusion until safety is proven." This is dangerously naive, as it ignores that delay itself is a massive harm. Withholding proven artificial solutions like vaccines or fortified foods for years costs countless lives to avert purely hypothetical risks. Your heuristic systematically blocks innovations that address immediate, certain threats like famine and disease. By prioritizing the fear of unknown future consequences, you guarantee known suffering in the present. Is preventing a speculative catastrophe worth the certain death we face today?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): The claim that delaying artificial solutions always guarantees present harm is false. Thalidomide's rapid approval caused thousands of birth defects; cautious testing prevented worse harm. You say "delay itself is a massive harm"—but rushing without safety proof creates irreversible disasters. Weighing risks: artificial interventions' unknown long-term effects often outweigh short-term gains. Isn't avoiding irreversible harm worth temporary delays?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Our position never advocated reckless approval; we oppose the blanket social norm that privileges "natural" over "artificial" regardless of evidence. The opposition conflates our argument with absence of testing, but proper evaluation treats natural and artificial solutions equally based on merit. They claim "temporary delays" are acceptable, yet millions suffer from treatable conditions while viable artificial solutions face irrational naturalistic bias that extends timelines beyond scientific necessity. The real trade-off is between evidence-based risk assessment versus ideology-driven rejection that condemns people to preventable harm simply because a solution is labeled "artificial."
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): A moderate social preference for the natural functions as a necessary precautionary norm.
When innovations like thalidomide, tetraethyl lead, or PFAS spread swiftly, society incurs long, often irreversible harms that stricter natural-first defaults and higher proof thresholds could have mitigated.
Your appeal to "evidence-based risk assessment" ignores realities: evidence is incomplete ex ante, regulators face capture, and marketing can overpower consent; normative skepticism counterbalances these structural biases.
Between temporary adoption friction and catastrophic tail risks, our side minimizes the worst outcome by making novelty earn trust while lifesaving exceptions still clear the bar—why gamble with irreversible harms just to neutralize a socially useful brake?
