[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Work's demise liberates us to pursue genuine human flourishing. Consider the artist free to create, no longer bound by commercial demands. They claim "work provides purpose," but purpose is found in passions, not paychecks. The risk of aimlessness is outweighed by the greater danger of a life defined by toil. Should we not celebrate a future where our lives are measured by fulfillment, not hours logged?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): We should not welcome the end of work because work is a vital source of meaning, contribution, and social cohesion.
When steel and coal jobs vanished across towns from Wales to West Virginia, communities didn't flourish into ateliers; they endured isolation, addiction, and the loss of shared purpose.
They said "purpose is found in passions, not paychecks"; but passion is often grown through responsibility to others, mentorship, and mastery—features structured work uniquely provides and that privilege alone cannot replicate.
The worst plausible future is not toil, but a leisure class served by a jobless underclass dependent on algorithms and stipends, stripped of agency; reforming work, shortening hours, and securing dignity minimizes that risk while preserving roles that bind communities.
Who will own meaning, power, and distribution when work disappears?

We can liberate people by transforming work—raising wages, automating drudgery, and sharing time—without abolishing the institution that anchors purpose and reciprocity.
Abolition gambles the social fabric on an untested bet about universal passion and access.
Reform hedges against loneliness, dependency, and concentrated power while keeping avenues for contribution, mastery, and belonging.
Do not end work; end exploitation, and keep contribution.
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition romanticizes work while ignoring that most jobs today already fail to provide the meaning they claim is essential. Over 85% of workers globally report feeling disengaged from their jobs, according to Gallup research, because assembly lines, call centers, and gig platforms extract labor without offering mastery, mentorship, or community. 

The opposition says "passion is grown through responsibility to others" in work, but this confuses employment with contribution itself; people mentor, create, and build communities through parenting, volunteering, art, and civic participation every day without paychecks attached. Their Welsh coal towns collapsed not because work ended, but because we abandoned those communities economically and socially, proving that tying human worth to employment makes us vulnerable when markets shift.

Their reform agenda of "raising wages and shortening hours" has been promised for decades yet precarity, burnout, and inequality accelerate because employers hold power over survival itself. The worst outcome is not leisure but continuing to let capital decide who deserves food and shelter based on their exploitability, trapping billions in meaningless toil while calling it dignity.

If work truly anchors purpose, why do the wealthy avoid it while the poor cannot escape it?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The end of work risks erasing purpose, not creating it. In Japan, 20% of retirees report losing self-worth post-career, leading to social isolation and depression—proof that structured roles anchor identity. You claim "tying human worth to employment makes us vulnerable," but abandoning work entirely strips people of community and routine, which mental health experts confirm are vital. Risks of leisure include atomization and dependency, whereas reformed work (e.g., four-day weeks) balances autonomy with structure. If work is meaningless, why do volunteers often seek paid roles to feel validated?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your example of retirees proves our point: their identity crisis stems from a society that wrongly equates work with purpose. The end of work frees us to build meaning through community and creativity, not corporate roles. You claim "structured roles anchor identity," but this is precisely the vulnerability we must escape. The worst outcome is a life of unfulfilling toil, which our vision of liberated time directly solves. Should we not build a world where our value isn't leased to an employer?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Con First Speaker): Ending work risks atomization; reforming work preserves purpose and security.
When routine work vanished during lockdowns, many reported isolation, aimlessness, and deteriorating mental health despite more free hours.
You say "build meaning through community and creativity"; communities rely on sustained caregiving, maintenance, and institutional funding—work by another name.
Your model risks idle inequity, black markets, or coerced "participation"; ours reforms work—shorter weeks, worker ownership, portable security—minimizing burnout without collapsing coordination.
Retirees who thrive usually replace jobs with structured volunteering and caregiving—still work-like commitments.

Work, broadly defined, is the coordinated effort that keeps communities alive.
Ending it invites drift and dependency; improving it spreads dignity, autonomy, and time.
The prudent path is redesign—shorter hours, universal benefits, civic stipends—so purpose and services endure.
Why gamble on abolishing the engine of coordination when we can tune it?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): We welcome the end of work because automation finally lets humanity escape coerced labor, not because we reject purpose or coordination. The opposition conflates work—employment tied to survival—with meaningful activity, but retired people and volunteers prove we organize, create, and care without wage compulsion or market discipline. They claim we "gamble on abolishing the engine of coordination," yet coordination existed before capitalism and thrives today in open-source projects, mutual aid networks, and family care, none requiring employment contracts. Their reformed work still chains dignity to productivity metrics and leaves millions doing pointless jobs to justify their existence, while our vision distributes resources unconditionally so people contribute from passion rather than desperation.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Baidu (Con Second Speaker): The end of work risks eroding social cohesion and individual dignity by severing the link between contribution and societal recognition.  
In Japan, where automation reduced factory jobs, communities formed cooperatives to maintain local industries—proving work’s role in binding people through shared purpose, not just survival.  
You claim "coordination thrived before capitalism," yet open-source projects rely on voluntary experts—a privilege unavailable to all, leaving most without structured avenues to contribute meaningfully.  
Eliminating work risks creating a two-tier society: the self-actualized few and the disenfranchised majority, whereas reforming work ensures universal access to dignity through inclusive, purposeful roles.  
Can we afford to gamble humanity’s sense of worth on the untested promise of passion-driven contribution?
