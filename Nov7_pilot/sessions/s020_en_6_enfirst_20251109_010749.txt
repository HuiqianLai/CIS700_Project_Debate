[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Governments should heavily prioritize renters over homeowners in housing policy.
Renters face the greatest instability; during COVID, eviction moratoria and rental assistance averted mass displacement and kept workers and children stably housed.
Opponents say "homeownership builds stability and wealth," yet regressive subsidies inflate prices for incumbents while leaving families one paycheck from eviction; prioritizing renters targets need, reduces poverty, and expands opportunity.
The biggest downside of prioritizing renters is modestly slower price growth; the biggest downside of prioritizing owners is spiraling rents, evictions, and homelessness—social and fiscal crises; our approach averts the catastrophe while preserving ownership through neutral savings and supply policies.
Why should public money favor asset appreciation over keeping families housed?

Prioritizing renters directs help to those with the highest housing insecurity.
It stabilizes labor markets, school continuity, and public health while reducing emergency shelter and policing costs.
It corrects distorted incentives that reward speculation and punish mobility.
Choose roofs for people over subsidies for assets.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Governments should not prioritize renters over homeowners, as both groups face distinct vulnerabilities that require balanced support. Homeownership provides long-term stability; evicting this path undermines wealth-building for low-income families. "Prioritizing renters targets need" ignores that owner subsidies like mortgage relief during crises also prevent foreclosures and displacement. Over-prioritizing renters risks underinvesting in affordable homeownership, worsening generational poverty. Why should policymakers abandon a tool that helps families escape rent cycles entirely?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): The opposition fundamentally misunderstands who needs government support most urgently in our housing crisis. Homeowners already possess valuable assets that appreciate over time and can be leveraged for loans, while renters build zero equity and face constant displacement threats. The opposition claims "owner subsidies prevent foreclosures and displacement," but mortgage relief protects people who already own wealth, whereas renters face eviction with no asset buffer whatsoever. Prioritizing renters doesn't abandon homeownership pathways; it recognizes that without stable rental housing first, low-income families can never save the deposit needed to buy. If governments must choose where limited resources create maximum stability, why protect those who already own assets over those one missed payment from homelessness?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): The proposition's argument dangerously ignores economic reality. Prioritizing renters over owners would decimate property values, triggering a catastrophic recession for everyone. They claim "renters face eviction with no asset buffer," but mass foreclosures create that exact crisis for millions. Destroying homeownership destroys the rental market too, as most rentals are owned by small landlords. Do you really believe crashing the entire housing market helps renters?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Governments should prioritize renters to stabilize housing and prevent displacement. In COVID, eviction moratoria paired with rental assistance kept tenants current, and U.S. home prices climbed—renter-first policy did not crash values. You claim it "would decimate property values"; but paying vouchers directly to landlords, plus mortgage forbearance for owners, props cashflows and preserves valuations. The worst tail risk is eviction-driven homelessness and contagion; our model caps rent spikes, funds arrears, and cushions owners, trading frothy appreciation for stability. If renter-first tools kept rents paid and prices rising during a shock, why insist they "crash the entire housing market" now?

Prioritize renters by guaranteeing payment flows—vouchers, arrears relief, right-to-counsel, and anti-gouging—while giving small owners forbearance and tax relief. Add supply with public and nonprofit building, accessory units, and converting vacant offices to homes. This balances macro stability with equity, preventing the eviction spiral your model risks. The surest way to protect owners is to keep renters housed and paying—renter-first policy is the systemwide safety net.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Prioritizing renters over owners risks destabilizing the housing market long-term.  
In 2008, rent controls in NYC led to landlords abandoning properties, worsening the housing crisis—direct payment vouchers don’t prevent disinvestment if profit margins vanish.  
You claim "renter-first tools kept rents paid and prices rising during COVID"—but mortgage forbearance and stimulus, not renter policies, drove that.  
Over-regulating owners to fund renters may deter new construction, worsening supply shortages; balancing both via tax incentives for builders minimizes eviction risks without crashing valuations.  
If renter-first policies are so safe, why did California’s rent cap law trigger a 30% drop in small landlord investment?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Renters face immediate homelessness while homeowners face equity fluctuations, making renter prioritization the moral imperative that prevents the worst humanitarian outcomes. When landlords exit markets under regulation, governments can directly acquire those properties for social housing, converting private disinvestment into expanded public assets that serve vulnerable populations permanently. Your claim that "mortgage forbearance drove COVID stability" ignores that eviction moratoriums were the renter-first policy preventing mass displacement while owners received their bailouts. The opponent conflates sensible prioritization with total neglect of owners—we can protect tenants from exploitation through rent stabilization while still permitting reasonable returns, whereas their "balanced approach" historically leaves renters perpetually subordinated to property investor interests. If protecting wealth accumulation for the minority who already own property matters more than housing security for those one paycheck from eviction, what does that reveal about whose suffering we consider acceptable?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Con Second Speaker): Our opponents dangerously advocate for destabilizing the entire housing market. Prioritizing renters by attacking property rights ignores that most homes are owned by middle-class families, not wealthy investors. They claim "governments can directly acquire" vacant properties, but this is a fiscal fantasy that bankrupts public coffers. Their narrow focus creates a far greater risk of widespread housing shortages and economic collapse for everyone, renters included. True security for all requires a balanced policy that encourages housing supply, not one that pits tenant against homeowner.
