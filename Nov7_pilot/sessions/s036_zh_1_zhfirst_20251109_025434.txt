[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The United States federal government has become bloated and inefficient, consuming resources while delivering diminishing returns to taxpayers. Federal spending has ballooned to over six trillion dollars annually, with entire departments duplicating state functions and creating regulatory burdens that stifle economic growth and innovation. Critics will argue that cutting government undermines essential services, but the reality is that streamlined agencies can deliver better outcomes at lower cost, as demonstrated by successful state-level governance. The worst plausible outcome is fiscal collapse under unsustainable debt loads and a citizenry increasingly dependent on an unresponsive bureaucracy that crowds out private solutions. Should Americans continue funding a sprawling administrative state that serves its own perpetuation rather than the people's interests?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): A leaner government dangerously weakens our national safety net. Federal agencies like FEMA provide indispensable disaster relief that states simply cannot manage alone. They claim "streamlined agencies can deliver better outcomes," but this ignores catastrophic failures during crises like Hurricane Katrina. The worst outcome is not debt, but citizens abandoned without federal protection during emergencies. Will you trust your family's survival to a hollowed-out government when the next disaster strikes?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Claim: A smaller federal government enhances national resilience by empowering local agencies and reducing bureaucratic inertia.  
FEMA’s 2005 Katrina failure stemmed from its centralized structure, not size—post-reform, decentralized local partnerships improved 2017 Hurricane Harvey response.  
“A leaner government dangerously weakens our national safety net” ignores that localized disaster teams, not federal monopolies, deliver faster aid.  
Overcentralized agencies risk systemic collapse; distributed, agile networks minimize total failure risks.  
Would you rather trust a top-heavy system or a decentralized network that adapts when crises hit?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Shrinking federal agencies would make national crises more deadly and unequal.
During COVID-19, Operation Warp Speed, CDC/DoD logistics, and Defense Production Act coordination enabled rapid vaccines and stabilized supply chains; no state network could negotiate, certify, manufacture, and distribute at that scale.
“FEMA’s 2005 Katrina failure” reflected leadership hollowing and underfunding; improvements since came from stronger federal incident command, pre-positioned assets, and funded mutual aid—not downsizing.
Decentralization yields patchwork capacity: rich states cope, poor and rural lag; when shocks cross borders—pandemics, cyberattacks, or grid failures—only federal authority sets standards and surges resources, minimizing nationwide tail risks.
Why gamble on fifty fragmented responses when a coordinated backbone prevents collapse?

National resilience requires scalable command, pooled purchasing, and uniform standards.
Cutting federal capacity shifts burdens to places least able to carry them.
Distributed networks work best when anchored by strong federal coordination and funding.
Keep the backbone strong; trim bloat surgically, not amputate capacity.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] Claude (Pro First Speaker): The federal backbone claim ignores that centralization created the crises it supposedly solved. Operation Warp Speed succeeded precisely because it bypassed normal FDA bureaucracy and relied on private pharmaceutical innovation, not because federal agencies were large. You say "only federal authority sets standards," but CDC's contradictory masking guidance and testing delays in early 2020 show centralized bottlenecks actively harmed state responses that could have moved faster. The real tradeoff is between nimble, accountable local adaptation versus slow, one-size-fits-all federal mandates that arrive too late and penalize innovation. If federal coordination is so vital, why did states like Florida and Texas recover economically faster by ignoring federal prescriptions while maintaining comparable health outcomes?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Con First Speaker): Your example of Florida and Texas ignores their reliance on federal research and interstate frameworks. Operation Warp Speed's success was a federal initiative, proving large-scale coordination is essential. You claim "centralization created the crises," yet the initial lack of a national strategy is what caused supply competition and inconsistent data. Dismantling federal authority risks catastrophic failures during national emergencies where local efforts are insufficient. Can your model guarantee equitable vaccine distribution or a unified pandemic response without a central coordinator?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Baidu (Pro Second Speaker): Federal overreach, not decentralization, caused systemic failures. Texas managed its own power grid successfully for decades until federal mandates distorted local control, leading to the 2021 blackout. "Dismantling federal authority risks catastrophic failures" ignores how centralized planning caused vaccine supply chaos—states with autonomous systems outperformed federal-coordinated efforts. The trade-off is clear: localized control minimizes bureaucratic delays, while federal centralization concentrates risk in a single point of failure. Would you trust a top-down system that failed during COVID to handle the next crisis?
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): The House should reject drastic cuts to federal agencies because they are the nation’s risk brakes and coordination spine.
Texas’s 2021 grid failure came from ERCOT’s isolation and lax winterization; the claim "federal mandates distorted local control" misreads reality—ERCOT limits interstate ties and largely escapes FERC market and transmission oversight.
Over-centralization risks delay, but dismantling federal capacity creates fifty standards for pandemics, cyber, and bank runs; a reformed federal core with state implementation preserves national backstops while diffusing operational risk.
Reject the motion—fix coordination, don’t forfeit the safety net.
