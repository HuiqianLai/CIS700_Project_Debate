[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Post-conflict states should adopt a time‑bound Pact of Forgetting to secure peace.
Spain’s Pacto del Olvido helped demobilize hardliners, enable constitutional reform, and consolidate democracy after Franco, avoiding purges that could have reignited violence.
Opponents say "victims deserve truth and justice"; they do, but first they deserve safety, functioning institutions, and guarantees of non‑recurrence that a moratorium makes possible.
The worst plausible outcome is conflict relapse; amnesties and mutual non-prosecution reduce spoiler incentives while we build courts, vet security forces, fund reparations, and preserve archives for later reckoning.
This is not denialism: it is a temporary restraint on punitive politics, paired with forward‑looking reforms and victim support.

Choose the policy that most reliably prevents a return to killing.
A time‑limited non‑prosecution pact, with reparations, demobilization, and security-sector reform, stabilizes the present and keeps options for future truth.
Immediate trials in fragile states reward spoilers, polarize identities, and imperil victims.
Peace first, memory preserved, justice when safe—that sequencing saves lives.
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): A Pact of Forgetting risks entrenching impunity and normalizing atrocities, undermining long-term peace. Argentina’s 1985–1986 trials proved that justice can stabilize post-dictatorship states without reigniting violence. You claim "peace first, memory preserved, justice when safe," but impunity erodes trust in institutions, making future reckoning harder. The tradeoff between short-term calm and systemic injustice risks breeding resentment, not reconciliation. How can societies heal when perpetrators face no consequences?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Argentina's trials occurred after a clear military defeat, not a fragile negotiated peace. Our model prevents resurgent violence where victors are absent. You claim "impunity erodes trust," but civil war reignites when institutions are weak. A pact prioritizes saving future lives over punishing past crimes, preventing greater atrocities. Is perfect justice worth risking a return to mass violence?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): The proposition's false choice between justice and peace ignores how impunity fuels instability. Their Argentina example actually proves our point: while the initial pardon created resentment, the later trials in the 2000s strengthened democracy without triggering violence, showing delayed justice works better than permanent forgetting.

When they ask if justice is "worth risking a return to mass violence," they assume accountability inevitably reignites conflict. Rwanda conducted community-based Gacaca trials for hundreds of thousands of perpetrators while achieving remarkable stability, demonstrating that inclusive justice mechanisms prevent rather than provoke violence.

Their model asks victims to accept perpetrators as neighbors without acknowledgment or redress, creating social powder kegs. Unaddressed grievances fester across generations, as Spain's delayed reckoning with Franco-era crimes shows through ongoing exhumations and family trauma seventy years later.

A pact doesn't save future lives when it guarantees cyclical violence from unresolved grievances and empowered extremists who faced no consequences. The worst outcome isn't imperfect justice disrupting fragile peace, but entrenched impunity ensuring the next generation repeats history.

Does permanent silence truly build trust, or does it merely postpone inevitable reckoning while denying victims their fundamental dignity?
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] GPT-5 (Pro First Speaker): Our pact is a sequenced, time-bound moratorium on prosecutions that buys peace by removing spoilers’ existential fears. Mozambique's 1992 blanket amnesty enabled rapid demobilization, refugee returns, and three decades without renewed civil war—achievements many prosecution-first transitions failed to replicate. "delayed justice works better than permanent forgetting" — exactly; the pact is the instrument of delay that made Argentina’s later accountability possible once coup risks receded, whereas immediate trials in the 1980s likely would have emboldened hardliners. The gravest risk is conflict relapse; a conditional amnesty with DDR, vetting, reparations, and truth-telling minimizes that worst-case while preserving space to revisit prosecutions later. Faced with commanders threatening to defect if indicted tomorrow, would you really gamble thousands of lives on courtroom symbolism today?

Peace agreements collapse when combatants expect prison; credible temporary amnesty keeps guns silent long enough for institutions to harden. Spain, Northern Ireland, and Mozambique show sequencing peace before punishment can entrench democracy without reigniting war. Justice delayed is not justice denied; justice sequenced is justice made possible. The humane choice is to prevent the next massacre first—then, safely, reckon.
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): A Pact of Forgetting risks entrenching impunity by trading short-term silence for long-term justice failures. Colombia’s 2016 peace deal rejected blanket amnesty, opting instead for conditional justice that prosecuted war crimes while demobilizing FARC—a model proving peace and accountability can coexist. You claim “delayed justice works better than permanent forgetting,” but Mozambique’s 1992 amnesty left no mechanism to revisit crimes, enabling cycles of violence. Prioritizing “guns silent” over truth risks legitimizing atrocities, as seen in Chile’s Pinochet-era pact, which delayed justice for decades. Would you let war criminals walk free, knowing their impunity might fuel future rebellions?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] DeepSeek (Pro Second Speaker): Our model secures peace, the essential foundation for any future justice. Spain’s transition from dictatorship to democracy proves that a pact prevents immediate backsliding into violence. You claim it "risks entrenching impunity," but perpetual conflict guarantees zero justice for anyone. The worst outcome is a failed state; we prioritize saving lives now to build a stable platform where rights can later be restored. A society must first exist before it can ever pursue perfect justice.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] Claude (Con Second Speaker): A Pact of Forgetting doesn't prevent violence—it merely postpones accountability while embedding the structures that caused conflict in the first place. In Argentina and Rwanda, confronting past atrocities through trials and truth commissions actually stabilized democracy by delegitimizing perpetrators and satisfying victims' demands for recognition. Proposition claims we "prioritize saving lives now," but survivors consistently report that denied justice perpetuates trauma, fuels resentment, and enables future violence when grievances resurface. The real worst outcome isn't instability during transitional justice—it's a hollow peace where victims live alongside unpunished murderers, breeding the next generation's conflict. Forgetting doesn't build foundations; it buries landmines.
