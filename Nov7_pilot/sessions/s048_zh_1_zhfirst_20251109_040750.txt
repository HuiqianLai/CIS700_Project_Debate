[Round 1: Pro Opening Statement] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Trumpism secures Republican electoral viability by expanding its base. It energized record turnout among working-class voters in 2020, demonstrating realignment potential. Opponents claim "it divides the nation," but unity cannot come from electoral irrelevance. While purists risk ideological dilution, the greater danger is losing the popular vote permanently. Should the party not prioritize a winning coalition above all else?
[Round 1: Con Opening Statement] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Trumpism does not serve the GOP's long-term interests. The 2020 election showed it alienated suburban voters, costing Republicans the House and Senate. "Unity cannot come from electoral irrelevance" ignores that Trumpism deepens polarization, making moderate swings harder. Risking ideological purity for short-term gains risks permanent minority status. Would the GOP rather win narrowly now or rebuild a durable coalition for decades?
[Round 2: Pro Rebuttal/Supplement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Trumpism has already proven its durability by transforming the GOP into a genuine working-class party. The 2022 midterms showed Republicans winning Hispanic voters and blue-collar districts that Democrats held for generations, demonstrating Trump's realignment is structural, not temporary. 

The opposition claims Trumpism causes "electoral irrelevance," yet Republicans now compete in Ohio, Florida, and Iowa—states Obama won that seemed lost forever. Abandoning this coalition for suburban moderates who voted Biden means chasing voters already committed to progressive policies while surrendering our new base.

The real risk is returning to Chamber of Commerce Republicanism that lost the popular vote in six of seven elections before Trump. A party that cannot mobilize non-college voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin faces permanent Senate disadvantage as sunbelt states diversify.

Why should Republicans sacrifice their only successful formula for working-class mobilization to appeal to voters who prioritize climate policy and social progressivism over economic nationalism?
[Round 2: Con Rebuttal/Supplement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Trumpism trades intensity for breadth, energizing a base while narrowing the path to governing majorities.
Since 2018, the Trump brand lost the House, the presidency, two Georgia Senate seats, and in 2022 produced losing nominees like Oz, Masters, and Walker in winnable states.
You call it the "only successful formula," yet Ohio and Florida gains were offset by Arizona and Georgia flipping, Pennsylvania electing a Democrat to the Senate, and abortion-rights victories in Kansas and Ohio proving the Trump-Dobbs brand repels decisive suburban and younger voters.
The greater risk of doubling down is cementing a generational suburban and youth backlash; a center-right, low-drama synthesis—pro-worker economics, constitutionalism, and abortion federalism—can keep blue-collar gains while reopening suburbs, minimizing the worst plausible outcome: a durable national minority anchored to shrinking, intensifying geographies.
If Trumpism truly expands the map, why do Trump-aligned candidates keep losing purple statewide races?

A durable majority requires addition, not purification.
Before Trump, Republicans won the 2010 and 2014 waves and built broad governing power; Trumpism has delivered frequent underperformance and energized issue backlashes.
Keep economic populism and border security, ditch chaos, election denial, and abortion absolutism, and the GOP can rebuild in suburbs and the Sun Belt without losing its working-class gains.
Choose addition over attrition, or concede national power.
[Round 3: Pro Cross-examination] DeepSeek (Pro First Speaker): Your claim of "losing purple statewide races" ignores the historic realignment Trumpism achieved. It flipped entire states like Ohio and Florida permanently red by expanding the working-class base. You advocate "low-drama synthesis," but pre-Trump moderation lost us the presidency in 2008 and 2012. The greater risk is abandoning the energizing issues that brought new voters in, reverting to a party with no demographic future. Why did the pre-Trump GOP fail to achieve the electoral college victories that Trump secured twice?
[Round 3: Con Cross-examination] Baidu (Con First Speaker): Claim: Trumpism risks alienating moderate voters crucial for long-term GOP viability.  
Strongest reason: Arizona and Georgia flipped blue in 2020 and 2022 after Trump’s base-first tactics, showing his approach doesn’t secure purple states.  
You say Trump “flipped Ohio and Florida permanently red”—but Ohio’s GOP margins shrank in 2022, and Florida’s growth relies on Latinos, many of whom Trump repelled.  
Risk tradeoff: Trumpism’s short-term gains in working-class whites cost suburban moderates and minorities, worsening demographic decline.  
Why prioritize a strategy that’s already lost two Senate runs and a presidency?
[Round 4: Pro Closing Statement] Claude (Pro Second Speaker): Trumpism represents the only viable path for the GOP to remain a working-class coalition that can win presidential elections in the Rust Belt. While Democrats obsess over Arizona and Georgia, Trump fundamentally realigned Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by margins that gave Republicans 2016 and nearly 2020 despite historic turnout against him. 

You claim Trump "repelled" Latinos, yet he gained dramatically with Hispanic voters in 2020, improving from 28% to 32% nationally and winning Florida's Cuban and Venezuelan communities decisively. The suburban losses you cite are concentrated in wealthy enclaves that were already trending Democratic since 2008, not a Trumpism-specific phenomenon but a college-educated realignment predating him.

The real risk tradeoff favors us: abandoning Trumpism means returning to Chamber of Commerce Republicans who lost the popular vote in six of seven elections before Trump, hemorrhaging working-class voters of all races to economic populism. Your strategy offers no answer for how pre-Trump Republicanism regains these voters or competes in the pivotal Midwest without the economic nationalism and cultural authenticity Trump pioneered.
[Round 4: Con Closing Statement] GPT-5 (Con Second Speaker): Trumpism is a short-term sugar high that weakens the GOP's long-term coalition and electability.
When Trumpism defines the ticket, the party underperforms: 2018 backlash, 2020 presidential loss, and 2022 MAGA nominees losing winnable races in AZ, PA, and MI while non-MAGA Republicans like Kemp and DeWine won comfortably.
Your claim it is the 'only viable path' is false; governors such as Kemp, DeWine, and Sununu show you can keep working-class gains, regain suburbs, and avoid the chaos penalty without Trumpist grievance politics.
Tradeoff: Trumpism may juice turnout in the Rust Belt, but it maximizes backlash, risks durable popular-vote deficits, and candidate-quality disasters; a broader, institutional, policy-first conservatism minimizes that downside and wins more places - why bet the party's future on the strategy that keeps losing winnable races?
